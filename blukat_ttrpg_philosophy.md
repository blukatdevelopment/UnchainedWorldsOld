# Blukat's thoughts on TTRPG philosophy

## What is a TTRPG?

### Anything
People can argue any constraint on a TTRPG is incorrect, citing a relevant example defying that constraint.
That's not useful to my purposes here, so I'm setting it aside.
This is the singular acknowledgement that what I say here will be "incorrect, but useful" in my eyes.

### Tabletop
This is a constraint of venue, format, and medium.
A TTRPG consists of a group of people gathered around a table, whether it's in physical or virtual space.
People may address the whole table, engage in side talk verbally or in written form.
The "top" of the tabletop contains tools to help facilitate the game, such as slips paper, dice, maps, miniatures, and books.
These tools are all optional, and could all be replaced with mental counterparts.
Unlike a videogame, the rules of a TTRPG are flexible and may change to match the fictional world.
These rules are likewise simple enough for the human brain alone to process.

### Game
#### Core gameplay loop
The core of TTRPG gameplay consists of three steps
1. The keeper describes the scenario
2. The players decide and describe their characters' actions
3. The keeper decides and describes the outcomes

#### Win and lose states
From the perspective of a character, the terminal lose state is perfect loss of autonomy, permanently ending the character's role as an avatar of the player. The intensity of this lose state increases with the disparity of the player's desires and the character's actions or state.
Likewise, the terminal win state is victory, where the player willingly gives up control of their character because the scenario is complete. The intensity of this win state increases with the harmony of the player's desires and the character's actions or state.
The vast majority of win and lose states are non-terminal, acting primarily express progress toward or away from a terminal state.
Hit points are a common measure of death. Having 1 HP can imply that the next fail state(taking damage) will be terminal.
Additionally, non-terminal states act to represent progress toward or away from other non-terminal states.
Having full HP often can imply that there are still multiple fail states(taking damamge) that will be non-terminal.
Resource management in general is a form of non-terminal win and lose states.
A low number of resources signals to players that tension has raised, and lose states will become more probable and impactful.

#### Game World
The keeper is responsible for understanding the fictional game world that the player characters will traverse and interact with.
Every detail of the world is constructed, either as a part of preparation before running a game, or as a part of running the game. Tools such as random generators or lore may assist with improvising details. Tools such as pen and paper may assist with recalling these details at a later time.

A world could be run as a continuous representation of space and time, but is typically divided up into discrete units. The spacial units are often nodes connected by edges to form a graph. Every combat grid is a graph with uniform edges. Sometimes, traversing a graph is a win state, or even a terminal win state. The units used for time are often borrowed from day-to-day life concepts of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, seasons, and years. However, time may also take the form of discrete actions or turns, much like those of a board game. In this sense, time can be a resource that players are forced to spend with varying degrees of utility. In another sense, time may act as a constraint in the form of a deadline for a problem. A lose state(such as a torch running out while the characters are in a dark space, a scenario being failed, or the end of the in-game world) may occur in the future, making the time left until the lose state is reached into a finite resource.

#### Scenario
A scenario consists of a set of conditions within the game world that prompt action. Generally, win and lose states are designated to end the scenario. Within the scenario, non-player characters, details of locations, and events may be planned ahead of time in order to provide structure.

### Roleplaying
The above description could be loosely used for a board game. What separates a board game from a TTRPG is a roleplaying element.
In roleplaying, the player and character are separate, but connected entities.
The player experiences the game world through the lense of the player character, who functions as a metaphorical camera.
When the emotions of the character translates to the player, it is called bleed.
Deep roleplay sees a character as an end to itself, and may or may not connect this to the challenge of the game.
Shallow roleplay sees a character as a means to engage with the challenge of the game.
For the sake of safety, discussing the content that may appear in a scenario before a game session begins gives the players a chance to prepare themself for challenging content, or for the keeper to alter the content in order to avoid unsafe or undesirable content.

## Procedure

### Decide theme for dungeon/zone
Give a 5 room dungeon a single theme. If you have a large number of rooms, make groups of 3-7 rooms and assign each its own theme.
An example of a dungeon theme might be "trial" with each room containing a challenge testing the party's mettle.
An example of a zone theme: you might pick "river" as a theme and have each room effected by an underground river.

### Select dice
You may roll a single D6 for each room. However, a five room dungeon may benefit from two or three dice. If you're creating a multi-level dungeon, simply relate the number of dice to the level of room. Increase the scale of rooms lower down if relevant.

### Interpret rolls
If a single element comes up multiple times, increase the intensity. M(1) may be a couple goblins, whereas M(3) might be a fortified and trapped goblin outpost. One exception may be for secrets, which you may simply wish to include one of for each roll.

A narrative dungeon is randomized and does not contain fixed spacial area to explore.
Instead, it consists of multiple sections.

## Making a section
Create a 2d4 wild table(or 2d6 if you'd prefer)
The first column contains types of room, with the last being an exit. The second column contains encounters.
When running, roll on each column. On an exact duplicate of a previous roll, the party gets lost and winds up backtracking. You may instead re-roll on duplicates.

Example Section
Rooms
1. Circular chamber with skylight
2. Long chamber with muddy floor
3. Room with stream
4. Exit
Encounters
1. Poisonous purple mushrooms
2. A hermit with a pet giant mole wants to trade
3. A giant burrowing crab breaks through a wall
4. Find inscription (DC 12 INT to tell they are primordial) Contains magic name "tunnel", which may be substituted for random name.

## Other uses
You could easily build these tables to work to facilitate travel, since it is as linear as this dungeon.

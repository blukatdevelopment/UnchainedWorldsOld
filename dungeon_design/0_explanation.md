# Dungeons

This folder contains files you can use to generate dungeons. Hypothetically, a campaign setting can be created by rolling multiple on a table containing these dungeons generation methods.

The idea is that procedures tend to create dungeons that feel similar. These procedures can be used to fill niches.

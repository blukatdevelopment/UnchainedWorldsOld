# Monstrosity

## Tentacle beast
A mass of writhing tentacles with a pod of flesh in the center featuring a beaked mouth. The tentacles have poison barbs, and when cooked and smoked are a staple in the tunnels for rations.

## Shelled tentacle beast
Some tentacle beasts mature to grow a hardened clamshell that opens in three symmetrical segments. These shells are often used to craft shields and armor by deepfolk. The creature is able to close it's shell and roll like a ball, moving quite quickly.

- Weapon-grab(reaction, when hit with piercing melee weapon): May make contested STR check to pull weapon from wielder's hands.

## Tentacle walker
Some tentacle beasts mature to grow longer, stronger tentacles that it entwines to create three fake legs to walk on and three fake arms. A ring of blue glowing eyes appear around the tentacle walker's beak. It is intelligent enough to throw rocks and wield objects as melee weapons, but demonstrates no social aspirations. The tentacle walker loses the poisonous barbs of it's tentacle beast phase.

## Pincer Beast
This hard-shelled bipedal creature resembles a crab. It has a hunchback and no clear separation between head and torso. It has two crab-like claws that can scissor through some steels. It's chitonous shell is a premium building material in the tunnels for it's durability, treasured as much for it's utility as for it's scarcity, due to the ferocity of these monsters. Pincer lack eyes and ears, but each has two antennae that resemble the end of a stalk of wheat with many tiny hairs that listen for vibrations of sound.

`Pincer Beast, Size: medium, HP: 24(3d8), AC: 18, Speed: 30ft [18,16,12,3,12,3], Pincer +5 3d6 slashing`

## Wolf bat
The wolf bat is a winged mammal with clawed feet and powerful jaws. They hunt in packs like wolves, and tend to single out one target to kill before moving on to the next.

## Giant Ant
Giant ants work in service of a queen. They are telepathically linked together while on the same plane, and when one is in trouble, the rest automatically know. without a queen, giant ants will wander randomly, killing anything in sight, including one another. Each giant ant additionally acts as a conduit for the queen's telepathic abilities.

`Giant Ant, Size: medium, HP: 16(2d8), AC: 12, Speed: 30ft, 25ft climb [18,16,12,3,12,3], Bite +4 1d8 piercing`

## Giant Ant Queen
Scholars believe that giant ants are not originally from this world. The queens dominate the telepathic hivemind of their colonies and exhibit a greater amount of intelligence than most wild creatures. Their strong telepathic abilities as well as their ability to mimic humanoid emotions makes them particularly dangerous, as they may telepathically take the form of a humanoid women to diplomatically pacify their targets. Queens are immobile and vulnerable when they are in the process of laying eggs. If the ant queen's avatar is targeted by attacks that deal psychic damage, the queen takes this damage directly, even if using a giant ant as a conduit.

It's speculated this creature was once a species of bear that lived in caves effected by wild magic corruption. It has four arms, patches of leathery flesh, and it's mouth drools a poisonous saliva. It has glowing yellow eyes that allow it to see in the dark up to 80 feet. It feeds on underground fungus and any animal that it can outrun.

- Berzerk: After taking physical damage, the Sha Karr becomes enraged and resistant to physical damage

## Mind Leech
This telepathic worm is not terribly threatening from a physical standpoint. It instead incapacitates it's targets with telepathically-induced fear before feeding on it. Mind leeches will not kill their targets, and will stop at 1HP when feeding, but they will lay eggs inside the brains of their still-conscious targets that hatch after 3d8 hours if not removed.

- Psychic Terror: DC 11 WIS save to halve 3d6 psychic damage. If target falls below 1HP, they are instead paralyzed for one hour and stuck at 1HP.

## Flesh Eaters
Once humanoids, but corrupted into monsters. Their minds are warped to feel no remorse, and to crave uncorrupted humanoid flesh. If one consumes the flesh of a flesh eater, they become corrupted and themself become a flesh eater. Flesh eaters seek safety in numbers, expanding their populations by force-feeding captured humanoids pieces of themselves. Their regenerative powers grow back flesh and limbs missing from them, but without skin. Instead of blood, flesh eaters ooze a black fluid.

Sometimes flesh eaters will alter one another, particularly when the mental corruption damages the target's mind. The swordhands is created by when a flesh eater's hands are severed and forced to regrow over swords. Additionally, a thin layer of flesh is sliced off their back and shoulders, and chainmail is draped over so that it meshes with the freshly healed flesh. 

`Swordhands, Size: medium, HP: 30(2d12+6), AC: 16, Speed: 30ft [16,12,14,12,7,11], Longsword +5 1d8+3`

- Rapid regeneration[Recharge 5-6]: Action, Flesh eater regains 2d12 HP, regrowing any missing limbs.

## Chaos Shells
Humanoids with souls corrupted by abyssal energy soon find their bodies and minds corrupting to match. For chaos shells, this process renders them agents of chaos. The whites of the eyes turn black, they grow in stature, and are overtaken with an insatiable sadism. Chaos shells are not concerned with killing their targets, but instead toying with them. Practical jokes of a horrifying nature are their most common preoccupation.

`Chaos Shell, Size: medium, HP: 36(3d10+6), AC: 12, Speed: 30ft [16,14,14,12,7,11], Fist +4 1d8+3`

- Power Word Ascend(1/day): Gravity reverses within a 500ft radius sphere centered on Chaos Speaker for the next hour.

## Infernoid
Once a humanoid makes a pact for infernal power, they can't go back. The infernal power corrupts, and the contract binds. With each new contract, the humanoid signs over a little more of their humanity. These contracts are most-often negotated at time of death.

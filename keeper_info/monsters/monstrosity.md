# Monstrosity

## Tentacle beast
A mass of writhing tentacles with a pod of flesh in the center featuring a beaked mouth. The tentacles have poison barbs, and when cooked and smoked are a staple in the tunnels for rations.

`Tentacle Beast, Size: small, HP: 8(1d8), AC: 11, Speed: 20ft, 20ft climb [16,14,12,3, 12, 3], tentacle +2 1d4 piercing + 1d4 poison`

- Weapon-grab(reaction, when hit with piercing melee weapon): May make contested STR check to pull weapon from wielder's hands.

## Shelled tentacle beast
Some tentacle beasts mature to grow a hardened clamshell that opens in three symmetrical segments. These shells are often used to craft shields and armor by deepfolk. The creature is able to close it's shell and roll like a ball, moving quite quickly.

`Shelled Tentacle Beast, Size: medium, HP: 16(2d8), AC: 12, Speed: 20ft [16,14,12,3,12,3], tentacle +3 1d4 piercing + 1d4 poison`

- Weapon-grab(reaction, when hit with piercing melee weapon): May make contested STR check to pull weapon from wielder's hands.

## Tentacle walker
Some tentacle beasts mature to grow longer, stronger tentacles that it entwines to create three fake legs to walk on and three fake arms. A ring of blue glowing eyes appear around the tentacle walker's beak. It is intelligent enough to throw rocks and wield objects as melee weapons, but demonstrates no social aspirations. The tentacle walker loses the poisonous barbs of it's tentacle beast phase.

`Tentacle Walker, Size: medium, HP: 16(2d8), AC: 11, Speed: 40ft, 20ft climb [18,16,12,8,12,3], pseudo-limb +4 3d4 piercing`
- Multi-attack: Tentacle walker may make three pseudo-limb attacks.

## Pincer Beast
This hard-shelled bipedal creature resembles a crab. It has a hunchback and no clear separation between head and torso. It has two crab-like claws that can scissor through some steels. It's chitonous shell is a premium building material in the tunnels for it's durability, treasured as much for it's utility as for it's scarcity, due to the ferocity of these monsters. Pincer lack eyes and ears, but each has two antennae that resemble the end of a stalk of wheat with many tiny hairs that listen for vibrations of sound.

`Pincer Beast, Size: medium, HP: 24(3d8), AC: 18, Speed: 30ft [18,16,12,3,12,3], Pincer +5 3d6 slashing`
- Multi-attack: Can make two pincer attacks.

## Wolf bat
The wolf bat is a winged mammal with clawed feet and powerful jaws. They hunt in packs like wolves, and tend to single out one target to kill before moving on to the next.

## Giant Ant
Giant ants work in service of a queen. They are telepathically linked together while on the same plane, and when one is in trouble, the rest automatically know. without a queen, giant ants will wander randomly, killing anything in sight, including one another. Each giant ant additionally acts as a conduit for the queen's telepathic abilities.

`Giant Ant, Size: medium, HP: 16(2d8), AC: 12, Speed: 30ft, 25ft climb [18,16,12,3,12,3], Bite +4 1d8 piercing`

## Giant Ant Queen
Scholars believe that giant ants are not originally from this world. The queens dominate the telepathic hivemind of their colonies and exhibit a greater amount of intelligence than most wild creatures. Their strong telepathic abilities as well as their ability to mimic humanoid emotions makes them particularly dangerous, as they may telepathically take the form of a humanoid women to diplomatically pacify their targets. Queens are immobile and vulnerable when they are in the process of laying eggs. If the ant queen's avatar is targeted by attacks that deal psychic damage, the queen takes this damage directly, even if using a giant ant as a conduit.

`Giant Ant Queen, Size: Huge, HP: 65(5d10+15), AC: 12, Speed: 40ft, 30ft climb [20,16,16,20,12,3], Bite +9 3d8+5 piercing`

- Berzerk: After taking physical damage, the Sha Karr becomes enraged and resistant to physical damage

## Mind Leech
This telepathic worm is not terribly threatening from a physical standpoint. It instead incapacitates it's targets with telepathically-induced fear before feeding on it. Mind leeches will not kill their targets, and will stop at 1HP when feeding, but they will lay eggs inside the brains of their still-conscious targets that hatch after 3d8 hours if not removed.

- Psychic Terror: DC 11 WIS save to halve 3d6 psychic damage. If target falls below 1HP, they are instead paralyzed for one hour and stuck at 1HP.

## Flesh Eaters
Once humanoids, but corrupted into monsters. Their minds are warped to feel no remorse, and to crave uncorrupted humanoid flesh. If one consumes the flesh of a flesh eater, they become corrupted and themself become a flesh eater. Flesh eaters seek safety in numbers, expanding their populations by force-feeding captured humanoids pieces of themselves. Their regenerative powers grow back flesh and limbs missing from them, but without skin. Instead of blood, flesh eaters ooze a black fluid.

Additionally, a thin layer of flesh is sliced off their back and shoulders, and chainmail is draped over so that it meshes with the freshly healed flesh.

- Rapid regeneration[Recharge 5-6]: Action, Flesh eater regains 2d12 HP, regrowing any missing limbs.

## Chaos Shells
Humanoids with souls corrupted by abyssal energy soon find their bodies and minds corrupting to match. For chaos shells, this process renders them agents of chaos. The whites of the eyes turn black, they grow in stature, and are overtaken with an insatiable sadism. Chaos shells are not concerned with killing their targets, but instead toying with them. Practical jokes of a horrifying nature are their most common preoccupation.

`Chaos Shell, Size: medium, HP: 36(3d10+6), AC: 12, Speed: 30ft [16,14,14,12,7,11], Fist +4 1d8+3`

## Infernoid
Once a humanoid makes a pact for infernal power, they can't go back. The infernal power corrupts, and the contract binds. With each new contract, the humanoid signs over a little more of their humanity. These contracts are most-often negotated at time of death.

## Mantis Man
During the Titan wars powerful weapons unleashed great wild magic corruption onto the land, and the Mantis Men are a product of this, ascending from common mantises. They are capable of non-verbal communication among one another, but are violently territorial toward non-mantises.

- Feed: DC 13 STR save or take 1d6+1 necrotic damage, which the Leech man gains as HP. Any excess is gained as temporary hit points.

## Sentinel
A partially biological weapon that outlived it's use in the Titan wars. This creature has an organic body resembling a werewolf, with their face, torso, hips and claw tips replaced with lost tech mechanical components. Their face visor displays a glowing image of their face, and opens to allow them to eat. Some Sentinels have overcome their original programming, but most in the wild are still seeking out and killing any armed humanoids they encounter. The Sentinel will not attack humanoids that are unarmed, or who discard their weapons. They will confiscate discarded weapons and destroy them, however. Their organic portions can be regenerated from the mechanical portions.

## Floating Eye

`Floating Eye, Size: small, HP: 8(1d6+2), AC: 10, Speed: Fly 30ft [10,10,12,12,7,15], Claws +5 2d6+3 slashing, `

## Spindle Man
A strange creature of legend. This creature stands ten feet tall, but has limbs only an inch thick and a bulbous head that looks like it should be too heavy for the slender frame. It has no hands or feet, with it's limbs terminating in nubs, and it's limbs seem to be prehensile and lack bones.

`Spindle Man, Size: large, HP: 33(3d10+3), AC: 10, Speed: 30ft [16,8,12,12,7,15], Choke DC 13 STR save or 2d6 necrotic damage`

## Muckbeast
This creature resembles a mass of mud with two human eyes and a gaping mouth. It's organs float freely within it's amorphous physiology, containing a layer of protection against it's heavily biodegrading mud-like muck. Muckbeasts can be found in swamps, but also wherever large amounts of decaying organic matter can be found, such as dumps, sewers, and battlefields littered with bodies.

## Needlenose
These up-right creatures are covered in hardened green scales, and though they have gills that allow them to breathe underwater, they are capable of living fully on land without issue. They are named by their three foot long proboscis which opens in three segments and reveals a very long spiky tongue that they can use to pith the insides of their victims. These creatures are feral, gathering in large nests, where they drag the corpses of their victims. When needlenoses consume the brains of their victims, they gain a temporary intelligence boost and become sentient for 24 hours, inheriting the memories of their victims. Generally, one or only a handful of needlenoses will remain intelligent, orchestrating their nests to provide them with a steady stream of brains to feast on.

`Needlenose, Size: large, HP: 28(2d12+4), AC: 14, Speed: 30ft, 30ft swim [16,11,15,5,10,3], Beak +3 2d8+3 piercing`

## Chameleoid
Appearing vaguely humanoid, this creature is monstrous than any beast folk, having a mind that is nearly feral. Their bulging eyes can turn in independent directions, and their three-fingered hands are capable of grasping objects. Their most distinguishing feature is the ability to blend into their surroundings.

`Chameleoid, Size: large, HP: 28(2d12+4), AC: 14, Speed: 30ft [16,11,15,5,10,3], Spear +5 1d8+3 piercing`

## Marionette Spider
These spiders are relatively intelligent and have adapted the to rigging victims up by several lines.

It's body can morph into that of a humanoid, and it can act as if it is in love, happy, angry, or participating in society as a humanoid, but it does this only as a smokescreen for it's strong instinct to lay eggs and feed it's offspring. Changelings have the capacity to overcome their instinctual urge to hunt humanoids, this happens to a small fraction of them, the rest remaining dedicatd hunters. Whenever a changeling changes, it leaves behind the skin of it's prior form.

`Changeling, Size: medium, HP: 40(4d8+8), AC: 15, Speed: 30ft 30ft climb [12,12,14,8,10,3], Slam +4 1d8+3`

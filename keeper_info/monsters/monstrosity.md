# Monstrosity


## Tentacle beast
A mass of writhing tentacles with a pod of flesh in the center featuring a beaked mouth. The tentacles have poison barbs, and when cooked and smoked are a staple in the tunnels for rations.

## Tentacle walker
Some tentacle beasts mature to grow longer, stronger tentacles that it entwines to create three fake legs to walk on and three fake arms. A ring of blue glowing eyes appear around the tentacle walker's beak. It is intelligent enough to throw rocks and wield objects as melee weapons, but demonstrates no social aspirations. The tentacle walker loses the poisonous barbs of it's tentacle beast phase.

## Pincer Beast
This hard-shelled bipedal creature resembles a crab. It has a hunchback and no clear separation between head and torso. It has two crab-like claws that can scissor through some steels. It's chitonous shell is a premium building material in the tunnels for it's durability, treasured as much for it's utility as for it's scarcity, due to the ferocity of these monsters. Pincer lack eyes and ears, but each has two antennae that resemble the end of a stalk of wheat with many tiny hairs that listen for vibrations of sound.

## Giant Ant
Giant ants work in service of a queen. They are telepathically linked together while on the same plane, and when one is in trouble, the rest automatically know. without a queen, giant ants will wander randomly, killing anything in sight, including one another. Each giant ant additionally acts as a conduit for the queen's telepathic abilities.

## Giant Ant Queen
Scholars believe that giant ants are not originally from this world. The queens dominate the telepathic hivemind of their colonies and exhibit a greater amount of intelligence than most wild creatures. Their strong telepathic abilities as well as their ability to mimic humanoid emotions makes them particularly dangerous, as they may telepathically take the form of a humanoid women to diplomatically pacify their targets. Queens are immobile and vulnerable when they are in the process of laying eggs. If the ant queen's avatar is targeted by attacks that deal psychic damage, the queen takes this damage directly, even if using a giant ant as a conduit.

## Mind Leech
This telepathic worm is not terribly threatening from a physical standpoint. It instead incapacitates it's targets with telepathically-induced fear before feeding on it. Mind leeches will not kill their targets, and will stop at 1HP when feeding, but they will lay eggs inside the brains of their still-conscious targets that hatch after 3d8 hours if not removed.

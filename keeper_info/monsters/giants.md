# Giants
Giants were descended from typical humanoids, having eaten of or been exposed to the marrow of the divines. A powerful magic runs through them, granting them, among other things, a size and density of skeleton unmatched by similarly sized creatures.

## Dwarf Giant
The smallest of giants are still formidable in combat. They seldom travel alone, providing most of the fine motor skills for other giants.

- Greatclub Sweep: Every creature in a 15-foot cone must succeed a DC 15 DEX save to halve 3d8 bludgeoning damage and avoid being pushed backwards 10ft.

## Hill Giant
Named because their heads are visible over hills.

- Stomp: One creature within 20ft must succeed a DC 15 DEX save or take 4d8+6 bludgeoning damage

River giants are feared because they capture land dwellers in nets and drag
them under water to drown them.

These creatures live among moose, dire wolves, and bears. They reflexively
kill humanoids, thinking they are all hunters coming to kill their friends.
They have woody vines growing on them, along with mosses.

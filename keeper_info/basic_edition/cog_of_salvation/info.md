# Cog of Salvation
## Setting
Dome city is inside a purple dome from the last ziggurat. The storm outside rages, as it has for as long as the elders remember. Tech priests have been repairing the second-to-last ziggurat to create a new dome, as the last ziggurat has begun intermittently failing. There is one missing piece, a magical cog is required to get it working, and teams have been sent to the bottom of the mines to locate it and save dome city.

# History

## Divine Age

### Creation
![Creation](../../../img/korsarus_creation.jpg?raw=true "Creation")\
The world was woven together by a pantheon of divines known as the weavers. The weavers created the world's plants and animals.

### Divine war
Soon, other divines were drawn to the world by it's beauty and began making many different peoples. Arguments over influence and territory lead to war, and many divines killed one another in a brutal war.

### Divine Exodus
Many of the survivng divines combined to form powerful divine entities composed of multiple aspects and left the world. Some went to Celestia, while others created the Nine Hells. Some minor divines remained on the world, hiding from the others.

## Dragon Age

### Birth of the dragons
Not long after the divines left, their bones were feasted upon by plants and animals. Many of these primordial creatures grew in size and figure, although the greatest of these creatures were the dragons, who arose from mere lizards. Dragons differed from the other creatures in that they gained vast intellect that made excellent use of their extremely long lifespans.

### Draconian Order
Dragons soon organized, creating an entity that ruled the world with an iron claw. Dragons were organized under a strict hierarchy, lesser dragons tasked with directly controling the inhabitants of small sections of land, and greater dragons tasked with managing other dragons.

### Dragon Wars
Though the order forbid dragons from killing one another, they did approve of war as a mechanism to settle disputes. Dragons funneled a great deal of resources into maintaining standing armies for such, often playing bluffing games with one another based on the prowess of their forces in lieu of actually staging battles.

### Dragon Slayers
The most highly-trained soldiers of the dragons became capable of killing dragons. While the act of deploying dragon slayers would have resulted in immediate and overwhelming retatiation by all dragons, simply posessing dragon slayers was not forbidden. As a result, an arms race to produce the most potent dragon slayer core rippled through all the dragon territories.

### The Great Slaying
Maddened by corruption, a great elder dragon ordered for the slaying of all others lower than him in the hierarchy. This precipitated a schism among the higher ranks, and soon several factions of dragons were at one another's throats in a war marked by the slaying of fellow dragons. Many dragons were lost at war with one another, and many more went into hiding, abandoning their subjects. An inflection point came when the slayers banded together to finish destroying the Draconian order.

## Titan Age

### Titan Rule
Rather than freeing the peoples who were so accustomed to living beneath draconic rule, the dragon slayers replaced the Draconic Order with their own system of rule. A hierarchy formed again, this time by raw power alone. Those at the top were named Titans. Any dispute, even that for the throne, could be solved by mortal combat in the Titan's graveyard, a stretch of uninhabited desert where the bodies of innumerable titans came to rest.

### Titanic Progress
The Titan age was one of unprecedented growth. Resources were directed into producing food, shelter, and goods for the world to flourish with. Great strides in science were made, and innovations utilizing the remaining bones of the divines were put to use to produce a surplus never seen before nor after. The expansion was a time of contradiction as well. Innovation followed strict siloing in order to consolidate power beneath particular titans. A class of tech priests were closely guarded and regularly assessed for their loyalty. Those who lacked zealous fervor for their overlords were executed immediately. A class of tech scribes beneath tech priests became literate with using, but never repairing nor reproducing the technology they relied on in their everyday life. These two classes resided exclusively in walled cities, where they could be carefully managed by the Titans.\
\
The majority of the world's population fell below those two classes, and were forbidden from entering the walled cities without passing inspection with rigorous criteria. Those cities which made public display of accumulated titan technology were routinely purged. This meant that the majority of the world benefited only from hand tools, participating in a system of broad resource extraction, funneling those resources into Titan cities.

### The Titanic Collapse
The standards for remaining in the walled cities continued to climb, resulting in purging tech priests and tech scribes. Backlash and subsequent purging became fed into each other, leading to much knowledge being permanently lost. An influx of new, loyal priests and scribes only managed to maintain the population while draining it of the knowledge it needed to survive. Increasing scarcity of precious metals and the bones of the divines only compounded the phenomenon of lost tech. It was not long before Titan states launched invasions of one another to retrieve these intensely precious artifacts. Libraries were purged in spite, both by defenders and invaders. Factories and labs received similar fates, leading to a purge of Titan knowledge. Worse yet, the weapons used by the Titans rendered most of their battlefields contaminated with powerful corruption agents, and subsequently monstrosities.

## Age of man

### Empire of man
Those who usurped the thrones of the Titans organized to become the empire of man. One by one, Titan states fell until the last of the Titan rulers had been slayed. So soon as the empire lacked an enemy, resistance heightened. Resistance fighters, who had filled the ranks of the Empire of Man, leapt into action. At knife-point, the Emperor declared the empire dissolved and sovreignty returned each province.

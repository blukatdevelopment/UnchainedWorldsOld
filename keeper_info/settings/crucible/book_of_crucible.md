# Lineages

## Human
Humans are the most common humanoid by far, and they vary heavily. While some humans stand eight feet in height, and others stand under four, it's most common for humans to sand between five and six feet tall. Rarely, humans have elongated ears, or those of a beast coupled with a similar tail. The most common complexion for human ranges from pink, yellow, tan, and brown. Green, blue, and crimson skin is exotic, but not unheard of. Humans were originally created by Bimros in an attempt to populate the world with worshippers.

## Beast folk
Beast have a vaguely humanoid frame, but their features are that of beasts. Fur, scales, feathers, and leathery hides are the norm for beast folk.

## Tiny folk
A lineage of magically altered humans who are roughly five inches in height. Their presence is highly valued in cogger culture, who regard them as benevolent beings.

## Giant folk
A lineage of magically altered humans who stand far taller than others, between 10 and 15 feet high. Their bones and hearts are magically reinforced to keep them healthy at this size. Field folk often treat giant folk with great reverence, recruiting them as town guardians.

# Time
## Epochs

### Divine Age
#### Creation
![Creation](../../../img/korsarus_creation.jpg?raw=true "Creation")\
The world was woven together by a pantheon of divines known as the weavers. The weavers created the world's plants and animals.

#### Divine war
Soon, other divines were drawn to the world by it's beauty and began making many different peoples. Arguments over influence and territory lead to war, and many divines killed one another in a brutal war.

#### Divine Exodus
Many of the survivng divines combined to form powerful divine entities composed of multiple aspects and left the world. Some went to Celestia, while others created the Nine Hells. Some minor divines remained on the world, hiding from the others.

## Dragon Age

### Birth of the dragons
Not long after the divines left, their bones were feasted upon by plants and animals. Many of these primordial creatures grew in size and figure, although the greatest of these creatures were the dragons, who arose from mere lizards. Dragons differed from the other creatures in that they gained vast intellect that made excellent use of their extremely long lifespans.

### Draconian Order
Dragons soon organized, creating an entity that ruled the world with an iron claw. Dragons were organized under a strict hierarchy, lesser dragons tasked with directly controling the inhabitants of small sections of land, and greater dragons tasked with managing other dragons.

### Dragon Wars
Though the order forbid dragons from killing one another, they did approve of war as a mechanism to settle disputes. Dragons funneled a great deal of resources into maintaining standing armies for such, often playing bluffing games with one another based on the prowess of their forces in lieu of actually staging battles.

### Dragon Slayers
The most highly-trained soldiers of the dragons became capable of killing dragons. While the act of deploying dragon slayers would have resulted in immediate and overwhelming retatiation by all dragons, simply posessing dragon slayers was not forbidden. As a result, an arms race to produce the most potent dragon slayer core rippled through all the dragon territories.

### The Great Slaying
Maddened by corruption, a great elder dragon ordered for the slaying of all others lower than him in the hierarchy. This precipitated a schism among the higher ranks, and soon several factions of dragons were at one another's throats in a war marked by the slaying of fellow dragons. Many dragons were lost at war with one another, and many more went into hiding, abandoning their subjects. An inflection point came when the slayers banded together to finish destroying the Draconian order.

## Titan Age

### Titan Rule
Rather than freeing the peoples who were so accustomed to living beneath draconic rule, the dragon slayers replaced the Draconic Order with their own system of rule. A hierarchy formed again, this time by raw power alone. Those at the top were named Titans. Any dispute, even that for the throne, could be solved by mortal combat in the Titan's graveyard, a stretch of uninhabited desert where the bodies of innumerable titans came to rest.

### Titanic Gilded Era
The Titan age was one of unprecedented growth. Resources were directed into producing food, shelter, and goods for the world to flourish with. Great strides in science were made, and innovations utilizing the remaining bones of the divines were put to use to produce a surplus never seen before nor after. The expansion was a time of contradiction as well. Innovation followed strict siloing in order to consolidate power beneath particular titans. A class of tech priests were closely guarded and regularly assessed for their loyalty. Those who lacked zealous fervor for their overlords were executed immediately. A class of tech scribes beneath tech priests became literate with using, but never repairing nor reproducing the technology they relied on in their everyday life. These two classes resided exclusively in walled cities, where they could be carefully managed by the Titans.\
\
The majority of the world's population fell below those two classes, and were forbidden from entering the walled cities without passing inspection with rigorous criteria. Those cities which made public display of accumulated titan technology were routinely purged. This meant that the majority of the world benefited only from hand tools, participating in a system of broad resource extraction, funneling those resources into Titan cities.

### The Titan Wars
The standards for remaining in the walled cities continued to climb, resulting in purging tech priests and tech scribes. Backlash and subsequent purging became fed into each other, leading to much knowledge being permanently lost. An influx of new, loyal priests and scribes only managed to maintain the population while draining it of the knowledge it needed to survive. Increasing scarcity of precious metals and the bones of the divines only compounded the phenomenon of lost tech. It was not long before Titan states launched invasions of one another to retrieve these intensely precious artifacts. Libraries were purged in spite, both by defenders and invaders. Factories and labs received similar fates, leading to a purge of Titan knowledge. Worse yet, the weapons used by the Titans rendered most of their battlefields contaminated with powerful corruption agents, and subsequently monstrosities. A secret band of Titan slayers known as the Radiant Order assisted the collapse of the Titan strongholds, not resting until the last Titan leader was slain. This is when the silent were created to protect the remaining secrets fo the Titans to prevent their rebirth.

## Age of man

### Empire of man
Those who usurped the thrones of the Titans organized to become the empire of man. One by one, Titan states fell until the last of the Titan rulers had been slayed. 

### The severing
So soon as the empire lacked an enemy, resistance heightened. Resistance fighters, who had filled the ranks of the Empire of Man, leapt into action. Their target were the guidestones, a series of 12 stone portals dating back to the dragon age. Destroying the guide stones effectively severed the connection between several major regions of the Empire. Unable to arrange large-scale trade and troop movement, the regions soon fell into revolutions that shrunk the empire of man's reach back to a wealthy core of cities no longer connected to a global trade network.

# Morality and Divinity

## Alignment
Crucible has a 9-point system of alignment. 

### True neutral (NN)
All creatures are born truly neutral. When they act, the aura of their soul changes to match. The acts of an average person tilt them neither to good nor evil. It is in continued acts towards good or evil that one's aura turns. As a counterpoint, one must consent to become lawful or chaotic, dedicating their life to it. This embodies true neutral alignment.

### Neutral Good and Evil (NG, NE)
Good seeks the perfect balance of maximizing joy and minimizing suffering for all, even when doing so does not benefit them. Evil, however, seeks to balance their own joy and suffering even when doing so robs the many of joy and brings them suffering. These are embodied in Neutral good and Neutral evil alignments. Examples of strong evil acts may be killing non-combatants, denying aid to those in need, or inflicting general suffering. Examples of strong good acts may be protecting the defenseless, giving aid to those in need, and generaly reducing of suffering or increasing joy. 

### Lawful and Chaotic (LG, LN, LE, CG, CN, CG)
Law establishes an order in the form of hierarchies via social institutions such as honor, law, and social norms. It believes a general shape of morality is valid, even if the particulars may stray. Chaos dismantles orderly social institutions in favor of discerning the shape of morality from each individual and in each individual moment according to the particulars. This encompasses lawful good, lawful evil, chaotic good, and chaotic evil alginments.

## Celestial Pantheon
Many lesser divines combined, forming more powerful divines containing multiple aspects. The celestial pantheon was formed by a few of these divines forming a loose alliance and creating a realm together from which they shape the world. They are perpetually in a state of cold war, their conflict limited entirely to the material plane where they compete using the prayers of their believers.

### Bimros
God of arrows, hunting, and dominion over nature. He created humans to rule the mountains, fields, and forests.

### Gegtex
Goddess of grass, trees, flowers, thorns, fruit, and rebirth. Creating the fae to protect her aspects as they are reflected in the Crucible's wildlife. Gegtex offers an oath to pursue this goal as well, granting druidic magic to those who take it.

### Kord
Goddess of sleep, ice, stone, and circles. Her avatar is a teal-skinned pointy-eared humanoid with white irises, and is known for leaving icy footsteps when she walks on land and water alike. Those who speak an oath to Kord gain magic that grows stronger in winter months.

### Uaos
God of agriculture. He has the head of a bull and carries a spear with a horn as the tip. He created the beast folk to worship him, and commonly grants small blessings and boons to farms that burn offerings to him.

### Yxheia
(Pronouncex "Eck-s-Hee-yah")
Goddess of knowledge, research, scrolls, and wisdom. Yxheia's oath is to preserve, spread, and pursue knowledge. Yxheia's temples always contain libraries that are open to the public, but are incredibly strict about the handling of books and scrolls, requiring flameless light sources such as sky lights and magic torches to be in use. Her scribes are often rewarded for their good deeds by gaining access to carefully guarded knowledge that is deemed to dangerous for the general public.

### Gidur
Creator of the waystones that mark the laylines across the world, Gidur is a divine of secrecy. Their aspects are unknown aside from shadow, and they deal exclusively in small cults. Gidur is happy to lose the game of being the dominant faith in the material plane. Rumors circulate of hundreds of different conspiracies they've worked towards, such as covertly hollowing a hills, constructing mazes, or growing a large crop of a specific mushroom, only to destroy it when it grows ready for harvest. Gidur's symbol is a special kind of glyph that becomes active upon completion. Anywhere his symbol is depicted, he gains a limited point of vision in the world. It's for this reason that it's considered taboo in most cultures to depict Gidur's name. Those who seek out Gidur's audience often use his symbol in graffiti, sometimes with nobles etching it under their courtroom tables, or artists including it subtly in ornate designs.

### Solus
God of fire, war, light, swords, and the sun, Solus is often represented by a symbol of the sun or a flaming sword. His avatar takes the form of a legendary flaming sword. Solus's oath of glory offers his followers magic on the battlefield through their sword, a popular choice for knights. The souls of fallen paladins of Solus are pulled into their blessed swords, turning them into sentient magical swords. Each temple of Solus requires at least one of such swords be on display. Followers of Solus occasionally speak of preventing the day of the flame, a hypthetical age when the world is so evil that Solus visits the material plane and turns the surface of the world to glass.

### Coent
Coent is one of the most powerful of the divines, comprised of dozens of aspects that are perfectly balanced in a slow dance. They embody neutral alignment. Their avatar slowly transitions, changing name from Coenta and Coento on a yearly basis, entering a pool of water in one form and emerging in the other. Various cults gather around a single aspect of Coent, waiting all year for that aspect to emerge and favor their individual goals.

#### Coenta
Coent becomes Coenta on the first of Coentas, assuming the form of a full-figured young woman with golden hair. In progression to the first of Coentos, her appearance shifts towards white hair, slender figure, and elderly features. Her younger form encourages romantic love, ignoring laws and norms, and the pursuit of individual joy. As she ages, she encourages a general familial love, shaping laws and norms, and the pursuit of universal joy.

#### Coento 
Coent becomes Coento on the first of Coentos, assuming the form of a bulky young man with fiery red hair. In progression to the first of Ceontas, his appearance shifts towards white hair, slender figure, and elderly features. His younger form encourages dutiful sacrifice, fighting evil law, and fighting individual suffering. As he ages, he encourages honorable service, reform of systems, and pursuit to universally end suffering.

## Undead

### Titan Kings
At the end of the Titan age, the kings were imbued with magic technology that was intended to render them immortal. It unfortunately worked, but not in the way they thought. Separated from their bodies, they sequester themselves away from those that would hunt them, and they bide their time, building cults and occasionally gaining ambition to overtake political regions indirectly.

## Abyssal Pantheon 

### J'ra, unrequainted prince
Those that enter the abyss and are tainted with uncontrolled lust are offered one last chance of survival by becoming lust demons. Lacking any ability to feel passion, these hordes seek to destroy the intimacy they cannot have. Any ounce of romance or love in the abyssal plane is bound to attract one lust demon, and then hundreds.

### Famine
Embodied as a dark cloud, famine is drawn to large stores of food in the abyss, which it devours. The souls that fail to be reformed into demons in the abyss are ultimately 

### Magara, the hoard god
Magara offers survival to the souls in the abyss by creating hoard demons, which each collect items for their specific hoard. Hoards may be all items of one kind, or items that remind the hoard demon of a person or memory they miss in their afterlife. Hoard demons are frequently sent to the material plane to seek out their items and add them to their hoards.

### Tuzzazz, the slumberer
The soul forest of Tuzzazz features many souls who have become demonic plants. Incapable of moving from the spot where they are transformed, they noneless seek to kill all that that moves freely in their land. Their weakness makes it impractical for them to harm any but sleeping or badly injured creatures, and so the demon plants are often harvested for materials by the other demons.

### Kirr, rage queen
Standing a hundred feet high, Kirr is a metalic crystal demon. She regenerates rapidly, and attacks anything in sight. The bodies of creatures slain by her are often reformed into rage demons, which sprout metal crystals to cover their fatal wounds. The shards of metal left behind by Kirr and her rage demons are the only renewable source of metal in the nine hells, and so Kirr is frequently attacked just to break shards from her and create rage demons to farm.

### Fusch the face stealer
Fusch uses their hordes to gather the faces of extra-planar entities. When they steal a face, Fusch and their demons are capable of shapeshifting into an exact replica of their victim and access their memories. No matter how many faces they get, Fusch and their horde cannot stop collecting more.

### Grokug and Porok, the conquerer twins
Each of the twins posesses a castle on opposite ends of the abyss, constantly raising an army locked in endless battle. Neither of the twins can create demons for themselves, and so are constantly recruiting from the abyssal planes. They offer power as a reward for slaying enemies and devouring their souls. Whenever either Grokug or Porok dies, their castle crumbles and a new one rises from the hell stone in another section of the abyss.

### Zimzin, the walker king
Zimzin is the king of Acedia, the only city in the abyss. Inside the city. The city is populated by walkers, creatures created that move through a sad parody of life. The walkers till fields of dirt, eating the dust from it to no effect. They drink dust, and they lay restlessly each night cycle. There are two permanent construction plans in Acedia: building the great wall, and then demolishing it.

## Infernal Pantheon
Devils are well-known for their contract magic. They occupy the upper layers of Hell, and are responsible for bringing in the majority of souls. They are lawful, and are organized within the kingdom of Hell which oversees the infernal plane. The kingdom of Hell has many temples throughout the infernal plane where crystals are stored. Should the owner of a crystal die they are reformed intact by their crystal, and then the crystal shatters.

### Nekatur, the seducer
Nekatur visits the lonely and desperate in the material plane. Often, her job is an easy one. She offers contracts offering to magically fulfill her clients' desires. With the money and favors she gets from wealthy and influential clients, she backs puritanical reforms, further driving demand for her forbidden services.

### Docla, starvation devil
Docla deals in extending the mortality of her clients, either by days, weeks, years, or centuries. Her payment comes in favors. Salting a crop, chaining someone in a basement with water, or robbing a grain shipment, Docla and her underlings are nourished by the hunger and starvation of others. In rare cases, she accepts long-term fasting as payment.

### Barnoth, fashion devil
Barnoth's power is from those who wear clothing in his ever-changing fashion preferences. His clients are almost exclusively those wealthy enough to commission these clothes, offering them favors ranging from assassination to magical powers.

### Brenzen, dream devil
Brenzen manifests in dreams, where she offers small contracts, offering bits of good luck in exchange for said dreams. She uses the dreams to build a network of information that she then sells to other clients.

### Korrath, Reaper of War
Korrath's clients are exclusively warriors, who makes pacts for soul-stealing weapons and armor. With his influence, he attempts to start and sustain conflicts, selling his weapons to both sides in order to increase his reaping.

### Pientara, the gossip king
Pientara has two categories of clients. The first are famous and influential individuals who he sells minor wonders and boons to in exchange for them to spread rumors. The second class of categories are other individuals, who trade favors and souls to spread rumors. Pientara can only spread rumors that are true, and so he works closely with Brenzen to source the gossip. Clients are often people in seats of power, and often pay to spread gossip of each other.

### Wro Gentar, devil of bodies
Wro Gentar offers her clients a very particular service. She forcibly swaps the bodies of two clients. They must each sign her contract. Often, she requires a sacrifice of a third party's soul, but great wealth works as well. The most common use of this contract is to extend the life of an elderly and wealthy client by swapping bodies with someone younger.

### Bestlar Mranag
Bestler's clients are those watching their freshly killed loved. He offers to save the loved one, and the contracts are quite lucrative. Once the loved one is alive, Bestlar hires others to kill them. The clients are rendered into a state of hopeless, bleak despair that he can harness for power. Contracts state that this happens randomly to every thousandth contract. The souls gathered this way wind up as the walkers in the city of Acedia.

# Corruption
Corruption is the effect that corrupting agents have on humanoids, often resulting in physical changes or transformations. The Diagnose Curse spell may identify a cure for a given corruption.

## Infernal
When devils outreach to the material plane, they often offer contracts with power. The full terms of these contracts are rarely clear to the signee, but some common corruptions are listed below. **Once a humanoid gains five infernal corruptions, they become a full devil.** 

### 1 Devil's Eyes
Your eyes turn crimson and slitted like a cat's. You may now see in perfect darkness up to 120ft, even through magical darkness. When a creature experiences physical pain, it glows red to you and the sight is pleasant.

### 2 Devil's Spines
Hardened spines grow from your body at various angles, providing a layer of protection. Clothing and armor must be altered specifically to fit your spines. Your AC cannot fall below 16. When you or another creature grapple one another, or you are hit with an unarmed attack, the other creature takes 1d4 piercing damage.

### 3 Devil's Wings
Bat-like wings sprout from your back, granting you a flying speed of 30ft.

### 4 Devil's Tail
This spade tail grants the owner the ability to cast the invisibility spell by consuming two stamina dice.

### 5 Devil's Horns
You sprout curved horns which may be used as a natural weapon. They use your strength modifier, deal 1d8 piercing damage. If you are not proficient in intimidation, you are now. If you were already proficient, but did not have expertice, you now do and may add double your proficiency bonus. You may use your action and consume a stamina die to impose advantage on your intimidation checks, and make a free horn attack if the check fails.

### 6 Infernal Hide
Your skin grows leathery, hairless, and crimson in color. It is warm to the touch. You have resistance to fire damage.

### 7 Devil's Tongue
Your tongue becomes longer and forked. If you are not proficient in deception, you are now. If you were already proficient, but did not have expertice, you now do and may add double your proficiency bonus. You may use your action and consume a stamina die to impose advantage on your deception checks.

### 8 Devil's Claws
Your fingernails turn into long black claws. Your unarmed attacks deal 1d4 slashing damage. You may consume a stamina die in order to cast the fire bolt cantrip, which forms the bolt of fire at a point between your claws. When you do so, it uses charisma as your spellcasting ability and deals 2d10 fire damage on a hit.

### 9 Marks of Infernal Fortitude
Three tattoos are seared onto your flesh, one on each arm, and one on your chest. When complete a rest, they dimly glow crimson. You may use your action to cast the False Life spell with the marks. You may exhaust one stamina die to cast the spell as a 1st level spell, or two to cast the spell as a 2nd level spell, or three to cast the spell as a 3rd level spell. While the spell is active, you are filled with infernal energy and red runes glow across your skin. An exhausted mark stops glowing until you complete your next rest.

### 10 Fiendish Quickening
If you have at least four stamina dice when you die, you automatically consume them and rapidly regenerate your flesh. Any limbs or flesh regrown is crimson, hairless, leathery, and hot to the touch. Your hit points increase to the maximum hit points. When you do so, roll for a new infernal corruption and gain it. 

## Abyssal
Abyssal corruption results from a humanoid's exposure to strong abyssal energy, such as by entering the abyss or by performing a deadly sin at a lay line.

### 1. Abyssal corruption: Lust
Your skin is tinted pink. Whenever you complete a rest, roll a 1d4. On a 1 or 2, you are otherwise unaffected by the corruption for the day. On a 3 or 4, the corruption permeates you. Your body temperature is feverishly warm and your cheeks are constantly blushing. You gain advantage on any ability or skill checks that rely on seduction, and disadvantage on any ability or skill checks that don't. These effects presist until you kiss a consenting creature.

### 2. Abyssal corruption: Gluttony
Your form grows more gaunt. When you see or smell a piece of food or a fresh corpse, you must succeed a DC 18 WIS save to avoid a feeding frenzy. A feeding frenzy lasts ten minutes, during which you leap upon any food or fresh corpse that you can find, feasting upon it. If you pass the WIS save, you cannot enter a feeding frenzy for another hour.

You no longer need to eat to survive. However, if you rest without having eaten that day, you wake the next day in a feeding frenzy. If you rest without feeding during this next day, the feeding frenzy becomes permanent and you lose your mind, becoming a hunger demon.

### 3. Abyssal corruption: Greed


### 4. Abyssal corruption: Sloth
Whenever you rest, you remain sleeping for 2d12 additional hours and cannot be woken from your slumber. For every 4 hour of additional sleep, you regain one additional stamina die.

### 5. Abyssal corruption: Wrath
Your temper becomes far more intense than you c

### 6. Abyssal corruption: Envy
### 7. Abyssal corruption: Pride
### 8. Abyssal corruption: Acedia

## Intro
Hello and thank you for being a keeper for this campaign! :3 Things might look
a little complex at first, but I assure you that you'll get used to them
shortly.

## Keeper cards
Each keeper has a card containing a simple description of the expectations
players should have going into that keeper's games. Below is a template, and
then a keeper card filled out for reference. Any time a keeper is running for a
given player for the first time, they should read off their keeper card and
invite any questions, comments, or concerns before beginning the session. You
can add more info than in the example, and put your card in the `#keeper-cards`
discord channel for easy access.
Template:
```
0. Hello, my name is <Name (pronouns)>
1. If anything makes you feel uncomfortable, say "I use my X-card" and we'll skip past the current scene.
2. <Describe goals as keeper, ideal gameplay>
3. <Describe Lethality>
4. <List potentially triggering content in your sesions>
5. Do you have any questions?
```
Example:
```
0. Hello, my name is Blukat(he/him)
1. If anything makes you feel uncomfortable, say "I use my X-card" and we'll skip past the current scene.
2. As a keeper, I like emphasizing problem solving, exploration, and roleplay over combat.
3. I run combat as war, not sport. By default, I won't shy away from lethal consequences.
4. My sessions feature graphic violence, body horror, filth, and death of innocent NPCs, which may be triggering.
5. Do you have any questions, comments, or concerns?
```

## How to host a session

### Come up with some content
A session should last anywhere from 2-4 hours. When in doubt, keep things
simple and flexible.

If you're at a loss for ideas, consider making a [5-room dungeon](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/downloads/5RoomDungeons_Vol01-18.pdf).
If you're still lost, reach out to the keepers, and we can try and help answer
your questions and provide guidance.

For every creature that you might fight during the session, it's a good idea to
either create a stat block, or locate an existing stat block you can use. This
can save you time in case an unexpected fight breaks out.

Feel ambitious? Create a thread in the `#Session-brainstorming` channel and
invite players to contribute ideas for your session. Player backstories as
well as their previous sessions might give you ideas.

### Setting info
The spire hosts gateways to other realms. Adventurers may also board naval
vessels or airships to visit distant islands. You may create your own settings
for adventurers to visit without worrying about continuity with the settings
that other keepers make.

### Foundry Setup
Creating a token in foundry can save you some prep time for when you expect the
party to fight a specific monster. As for a map, there are usually a few blank
maps you can draw on for a general battle grid. If you have something more
specific in mind, you can upload a map. Websites such as [Dungeon Scrawl](https://www.dungeonscrawl.com/) or
[Donjon](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/dungeon/) can be helpful in creating
dungeon maps. Due to technical limitations, please upload roughly one map at a
time so that the foundry server does not lag. Cleaning up after yourself is
a good practice, and can make life for the other keepers easier.

### Music
Fredboat is our music player. You can play audio from youtube videos like this:
`/play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
Be aware that music players like this can randomly experience technical issues.
If Fredboat isn't working, you can ask players to quietly play tracks on their
computers and continue on with the session.

### After the session
When you wrap a session up, jot down the rewards earned, and about 5
bullet-points explaining what happened into the session's thread. Invite players
to add their own notes for future reference.

## Guidelines

### Rewards
You can set whatever rewards you think are reasonable. If you'd like guidance,
decide a level for your session(taking the average of the party playing may
help with that) and reward each member of the party according to the XP and GP
shown, regardless of what level the character is. This narrows level gaps over
time.

```

+-------+------+-----+
| Level |  XP  | GP  |
+-------+------+-----+
|     1 |  150 |  10 |
|     2 |  300 |  25 |
|     3 |  450 |  50 |
|     4 |  900 |  75 |
|     5 |  900 | 125 |
|     6 | 1200 | 200 |
|     7 | 1500 | 225 |
|     8 | 2000 | 250 |
|     9 | 2000 | 300 |
|    10 | 2000 | 400 |
+-------+------+-----+
```

### Pets
Adventurers may bring home pets from time to time. Pets may be released back
into the wild, or live with the adventurers in their dorms. 

#### Pet Upkeep
While the Spire offers free room and board to adventurers, there is a pet fee
represented in a percentage cut of an adventurer's income on contracts. This
fee is paid per pet, so an adventurer may not have more than 20 medium or
smaller creatures as pets.

```
+-----+----------------------------+
| Fee |          Creature          |
+-----+----------------------------+
| 5%  | Medium or smaller creature |
| 15% | Large creature             |
| 30% | Huge or larger creature    |
+-----+----------------------------+
```

#### Bringing pets adventuring
Adventurers may bring their pets on adventures, provided they give keepers
sufficient time to create a stat block. If a stat block is not yet prepared, the
pet is considered in training. Pets share the initiative order with their owners
and take the dodge action unless the owner uses their bonus action to issue a
command.

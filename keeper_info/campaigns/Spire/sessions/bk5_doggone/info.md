# Let the Doggone Show Go On

Message from Envy:
```
Well, dweebs, guess who won us a new contract? This one's a bit strange. DogCorp's hiring guards to keep the peace at the yearly interdimensional dog show. Last year, which was yesterday for us, some contestants were disqualified for being polymorphed humanoids. They vowed to take revenge on next year's show, which is today. Just try and catch cheaters, and handle any nonsense that happens. Also, try not to kill anyone there. DogCorp doesn't want the event associated with violence.
```

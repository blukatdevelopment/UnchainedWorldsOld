# Cola Wars
Message from Envy
```
Oh, hell yeah! I think I found a client who can give you twerps consistent work. So apparently this infinite sea isn't so infinite. A representative from an anonymous cola company is willing to pay us to clear an uninhabited island of it's monster nest. I'll also pay you nerds for any eggs or live specimen you can capture. Y'know, because I'm a scientist, and all.
```

### Character creation
1. Pick or roll (1d10) a culture
2. Pick a class 
3. Move stats around if desired to match class
4. Get or draw token art

### Keeper card
```
0. Hello, my name is Blukat(she/her)
1. If anything makes you feel uncomfortable, say "I use my X-card" and we'll skip past the current scene.
2. As a keeper, I like emphasizing problem solving, exploration, and roleplay over combat.
3. I run combat as war, not sport. By default, I won't shy away from lethal consequences.
4. My sessions feature graphic violence, body horror, filth, and death of innocent NPCs, which may be triggering.
5. Do you have any questions, comments, or concerns?
```

# Journey
## House of Gold
Scripted interaction

1. Envy enters from her bedroom, excited.
2. "Ite, nerds. We actually have a contract with a real client. If you do a decent job on this one, you're bound to get more work from them."
3. Ask everyone to explain themselves, ask for followup questions.
4. "Ite, so all I got is this map right here. Coordinates 4523 by 3234"
5. "Oh, and you'll need to sort out a boat. Don't worry, there's plenty down on the dock levels."

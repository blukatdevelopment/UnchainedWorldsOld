# Operation: Demon Retrieval
Message from Mercy
```
Oh, hey everyone! It's come to my attention that one of our adventurers, Magnus, was captured during our last contract. Though Envy is busy finding us new lucrative business contracts, I'd like to assemble a strike team to get back our friend. I can't promise you any gold reward, but your conscience is going to feel a lot better after our friend is back safely. I won't lie. This is going to be dangerous. With help from Keal, I've pin-pointed the location that Magnus will be taken to. If we don't act quickly, he'll be experimented on.

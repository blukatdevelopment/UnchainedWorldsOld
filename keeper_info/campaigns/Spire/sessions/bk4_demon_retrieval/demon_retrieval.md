# Operation: Demon Retrieval
Message from Mercy
```
Oh, hey everyone! It's come to my attention that one of our adventurers, Magnus, was captured during our last contract. Though Envy is busy finding us new lucrative business contracts, I'd like to assemble a strike team to get back our friend. I can't promise you any gold reward, but your conscience is going to feel a lot better after our friend is back safely. I won't lie. This is going to be dangerous. With help from Keal, I've pin-pointed the location that Magnus will be taken to. If we don't act quickly, he'll be experimented on.

# Resources
## Intel
Mercy guilted Envy to do some research.

### Resources
- Expansion Enterprises Airship: They can safely land at the airstrip, but will bug out if things get hot.
- Fake low-security IDs: These will allow you to pass on roads, but not in restricted zones.
- Contact: someone named Beth in the town's tavern claims to have more information.
- Radio: We can snoop on their comms while we're there. That's how I got half the info I have, honestly.
- Explosives: Someone stashed a stack of demo charges in the farm. That cost me very fucking dearly.

### Threats
- Lighthouses: If these things illuminate an unknown vessel or person in the water, alarms will be tripped.
- Cannon: This thing is capable of taking out an airship or boat pretty easily from long range.
- Alarms: Seems like radios are limited to officers on the island, but can be used to raise an alarm.
- Counterstrike team: If alarms are tripped, there's a small reserve at ready.
- Army: If things get hot and you dawdle, you'll
- Navy: There's a variety of mercenary vessels in the shipyard.
- Air: On high alert, they'll scramble some interceptors. They're made to shoot down other aircraft, but can still harm you on the ground.

### Targets
- Town: there's a good chance of finding additional info here
- Power Plant: Many of the systems on the island rely on some sort of arcane power source
- Bridges: Though tere are many ships, it looks like ground troops are bottlenecked by bridges
- Lab: If Magnus is being studied or dissected, this is where he'll be.
- Prison: If magnus is being held for an extended period, he'll be here.

# Base mechanics

## Magnus's location timeline(based on time of party arrival)
- 0 hours: Magnus is loaded into prison from submarine. Radio: "Angry whale docking at prison."
- 1-8 hours: Magnus interrogated in prison

- 10 hours: Magnus arrives at lab, tests begin

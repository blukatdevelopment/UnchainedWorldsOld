# Frogs aplenty

Message from Envy
```
Sup, nerds! I got a lead for a job in Arcanus. The plumbers guild is getting
complaints that frogs keep coming out of the sewers through drains, sinks, and
toilets. Frankly, it's a crying shame I'm up to my whiskers in paperwork right
now. 
```

## Intro

### Character creation
1. Pick or roll (1d10) a culture
2. Pick a class 
3. Move stats around if desired to match class
4. Get or draw token art


### Keeper Card
```
0. Hello, my name is Blukat(he/him)
1. If anything makes you feel uncomfortable, say "I use my X-card" and we'll skip past the current scene.
2. As a keeper, I like emphasizing problem solving, exploration, and roleplay over combat.
3. I run combat as war, not sport. By default, I won't shy away from lethal consequences.
4. My sessions feature graphic violence, body horror, filth, and death of innocent NPCs, which may be triggering.
5. Do you have any questions, comments, or concerns?
```


## Surface
### House of Gold
Scripted interaction

1. Hear wine bottles clattering, Envy steps in to introduce herself and the
mission.
2. "And, uh, who are you two?"
3. One followup question about each, depending on their description.
4. "Alright. Well, this is serious frog business. Plumbers guild says there's
frogs coming out of the sewers. Go solve that problem, and  you'll get paid."
5. "Fine, follow me through the gates. This one right here leads to Arcanus."
6. "Oh, and one last thing. Take this letter. It should help people know who
sent you, and where you're going if you get lost."

### City of Arcanus (Entrance and guardian)
- Gate exits in art museum
- Marble pillars and stone
- Tour guide walks up, looks nervous, tries to fake description of "wax statues"
- Tour guide knows where sewer and plumbers guild hall are.


#### Plumber's guild hall
- Stopped by Ratcliff gang (3 cutpurses, ratfolk) who want 15 GP each
- Guild rep is old, grouchy sloth
- "Our bean counters estimate the frog population has been doubling every 48 hours or so"
- Hand out brochure. "You can use this as a map. A decade ago it was used for
the failed sewer housing initiative"

```
Welcome to my domain, children of the surface. I trust that you have come to
me seeking relief from your frog problem. Look no further. It is I, Eudaimonia,
who have been growing their ranks. I have your attention now. Tirelessly working
toward my duties of preserving city's bowels, I nonetheless yearn for more. I
have become lonely. I seek company. Bring it to me, or the world will be drown
in a flood of frogs. Bring me a companion.

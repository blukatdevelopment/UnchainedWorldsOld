# University
This campaign covers one semester in a magical university.

## Academics
Students are enrolled in four classes and in order to graduate must pass one midterm exam and one final exam during a given semester. **Exams** are open-ended challenges made easier by learning abilities, skills, and spells from completing weekly **quizzes** in the four subjects.

### Classes
There are four classes concerned with different aspects of a mage.

#### Mind
Reading, writing, arithmetic, chemistry, biology, alchemy, history, clockwork, linguistics, and runesmithing.

#### Body
Sensory acuity, acrobatics, athletics, fencing, archery, broom flying, horseriding, sailing, and stealth.

#### Spirit
Religion, divination, ritual spellcasting.

#### Soul
Persuasion, deception, intimidation, insight, magic sensitivity, naming, muse magic.

### Taking quizzes
Each quiz has a difficulty indicated by it's die size. To take a quiz, you roll this die and add any bonuses. You pass if this rolled value is equal to or higher than the die size(so for a D6 you'd need a 6 or higher).

### Studying for quizzes
Every day features **coursework**, which you take in the same way as a quiz(roll die, add bonus, check for max or higher value). Every successful day of coursework grants a +1 bonus to that class's weekly quiz, up to a maximum of +5. To increase your odds of succeeding at coursework, you may spend some of your four hours of free time each night studying one of the four subjects. Each hour spent studying a given subject gives a +1(max +4) bonus on the coursework the next day.

## Extracurricular Activities
In addition to studying coursework, students may pursue other activities unrelated to passing their classes.

### Broomball League
The university proudly flies it's banner and plays it's anthem to introduce it's broomball team to the field. Though the game is dangerous and occasionally deadly, it is a beloved spectacle for the university that brings in significant revenue. Winning broomball tournaments can fast-track a student to fame and fortune far beyond the walls of the university.

### The 'Ficery
The artificery is a dangerous alchemy lab where materials and contraptions are built for commission or personal use. Work requires the utmost care, and caries the risk of dangerous and even deadly accidents.

### The Brawlers Club
Though violence is strictly forbidden by on campus, the brawlers club meets in adjacent venues to fight for reputation and cash prizes. Training for the brawler's club increases physical readiness for combat.

### The Moonlight Society
Many students and faculty are passionate about poetry, theater, and other arts for a variety of reasons, pursuing it even though it isn't included in any curiculum. The Moonlight Society meets at night past curfew, in order to express themselves without fear of judgement from faculty and the broader student body. In addition to art, some seek the Moonlight Society as a marketplace for secrets and favors.

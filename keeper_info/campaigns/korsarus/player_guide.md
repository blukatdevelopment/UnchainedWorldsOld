# Quickstart Guide

## Your first character
Your first character is a typical commoner. Use this character's short lifespan as a tutorial for interacting with the world of Korsarus. Change the name from "Fresh Meat", or don't.

### Your backstory
You were born and raised in the filthy slums of the copper ring of Korsarus City. Whether your old life involved shoveling maneur, begging on the street, or picking pockets is irrelevant. You've got nothing to show for that life, and are taking, and nothing to lose by abandoning it.

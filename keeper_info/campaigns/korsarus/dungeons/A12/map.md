Leech Man + Swarm of Heart Worms + Huge Polar Bear

## Swarm of Heart Worms
These three-inch worms often congregate in carrion, waiting for a creature with a large heart to come near. Once they surface, they attempt to burrow into their target's flesh and move towards their heart, which they devour.

`Swarm of Heart Worms, Size: small, HP: 8(2d4), AC: 10, Speed: 5ft [10,10,10,3,3,3]`
- Burrow: +4 1 piercing. On a hit, one worm per HP burrows beneath the skin. Using fire on their next turn, the target may burn the heart worms under their skin, dealing 1 fire damage per worm killed. If the worms are still burrowing at the end of their target's next turn, they successfully hide in the creature's flesh. The creature has 1d4 hours before the worms reach their heart and kill them.

## Leech Man
Wild magic replaced the heads of these humanoids with those of giant leeches. They drink the blood of their victims.

`Leech Man, Size: medium, HP: 5(1d4+1), AC: 11, Speed: 30ft [12,12,12,12,7,15], club +3 1d4+1`
- Feed: DC 13 STR save or take 1d6+1 necrotic damage, which the Leech man gains as HP. Any excess is gained as temporary hit points.

# Traps
0: Entangling swinging blades and ethereal javelins triggered by a child's toy.
1:  Weapon Thruster - Upon triggering the trap a thrusting weapon (blades, harpoon, lances, needles, spears, spikes) extends out of holes in a nearby (ceiling, floor, wall) or other surface. The holes may be concealed with a thin layer of easily breakable material like paper-mache or a thin layer of plaster. For additional fun, the weapons may be barbed, poisoned, or rusty.
2:  A thin hallway/crawlspace is blocked by a series of supports. Close inspection shows many of them to be immovable rods. Deactivation or destruction of the rods will cause the ceiling to collapse onto the entire hallway.
3: Imprisoning - frictionless bowl, levitation prison, magic barrier prison
4: Raise The Dead - summons the ghost of all the corpses in the area & compels them to attack intruders
5:  Deadfall Trap (liquid) - Triggering the trap causes some type of liquid to dump or spill onto victim. (acid, flammable oil, hot pepper juice, ink, insect attack pheromones, monster attractant, slime monster)
6: Magical Attraction - upon touching the magically trapped bait item. All the objects in the room fly towards the victim with deadly force
7: Entangling - chains, grabbing hands, sticky floor, tentacles, vines, webs
8: Oven - doors of room close, then fire under grate in floor slowly cooks anything in room / room is full of flammable materials which are ignited by trap

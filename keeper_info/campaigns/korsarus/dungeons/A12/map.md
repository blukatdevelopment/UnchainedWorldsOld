Leech Man + Swarm of Heart Worms + Huge Polar Bear

## Swarm of Heart Worms
These three-inch worms often congregate in carrion, waiting for a creature with a large heart to come near. Once they surface, they attempt to burrow into their target's flesh and move towards their heart, which they devour.

`Swarm of Heart Worms, Size: small, HP: 8(2d4), AC: 10, Speed: 5ft [10,10,10,3,3,3]`
- Burrow: +4 1 piercing. On a hit, one worm per HP burrows beneath the skin. Using fire on their next turn, the target may burn the heart worms under their skin, dealing 1 fire damage per worm killed. If the worms are still burrowing at the end of their target's next turn, they successfully hide in the creature's flesh. The creature has 1d4 hours before the worms reach their heart and kill them.

## Leech Man
Wild magic replaced the heads of these humanoids with those of giant leeches. They drink the blood of their victims.

`Leech Man, Size: medium, HP: 5(1d4+1), AC: 11, Speed: 30ft [12,12,12,12,7,15], club +3 1d4+1`
- Feed: DC 13 STR save or take 1d6+1 necrotic damage, which the Leech man gains as HP. Any excess is gained as temporary hit points.

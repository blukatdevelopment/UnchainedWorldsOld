## Mind Leech
This telepathic worm is not terribly threatening from a physical standpoint. It instead incapacitates it's targets with telepathically-induced fear before feeding on it. Mind leeches will not kill their targets, and will stop at 1HP when feeding, but they will lay eggs inside the brains of their still-conscious targets that hatch after 3d8 hours if not removed.

`Mind Leech, Size: small, HP: 1, AC: 8, Speed: 10ft [6,6,6,16,12,3], Feed +1 1 piercing damage`
- Psychic Terror: DC 11 WIS save to halve 3d6 psychic damage. If target falls below 1HP, they are instead paralyzed for one hour and stuck at 1HP.

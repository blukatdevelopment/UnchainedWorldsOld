## Grinder
This spherical demon opens into two hemispheres joined by a central stalk. Teeth brim at the edges where these pieces meet, forming a 360 degree mouth. Grinders gnash their teeth constantly, compelled to chew through stone despite the pain it causes them. They have eyes on all sides, and three legs.

`Grinder, XP: 100, HP: 38(4d8+6), AC: 14, [16, 10, 14, 10, 10, 10], Slam +4 1d6+3 bludgeoning, Bite +4 1d8+3 piercing`

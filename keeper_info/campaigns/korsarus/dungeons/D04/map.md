Flesh Eaters + Muckbeast

## Muckbeast
This creature resembles a mass of mud with two human eyes and a gaping mouth. It's organs float freely within it's amorphous physiology, containing a layer of protection against it's heavily biodegrading mud-like muck. Muckbeasts can be found in swamps, but also wherever large amounts of decaying organic matter can be found, such as dumps, sewers, and battlefields littered with bodies.

`Muckbeast, Size: large, HP: 33(3d12+9), AC: 10, Speed: 15ft [12,8,16,3,7,3], Smother +5 3d6+3 necrotic`
- Biodegrading muck: Organic matter such as wood that touches the creature is quickly eaten away, destroying weapons such as spears and clubs used against it. An organic creature that touches the muckbeast takes 1d8 necrotic damage.
- Much stream(recharge 5-6): The muckbeast heaves and spews muck onto one creature within 10ft. If the creature is organic, it must make a DC 13 CON save to halve 3d6 necrotic damage.


## Flesh Eaters
Once humanoids, but corrupted into monsters. Their minds are warped to feel no remorse, and to crave uncorrupted humanoid flesh. If one consumes the flesh of a flesh eater, they become corrupted and themself become a flesh eater. Flesh eaters seek safety in numbers, expanding their populations by force-feeding captured humanoids pieces of themselves. Their regenerative powers grow back flesh and limbs missing from them, but without skin. Instead of blood, flesh eaters ooze a black fluid.

`Flesh Eater, Size: medium, HP: 28(2d12+4), AC: 11, Speed: 30ft [14,12,14,12,7,11], Spear +4 1d8+2`

Infernoids + Giant Hand + Arch Fey

## Giant Hand
Another puzzling product of wild magic corruption, this creature appears to be a giant hand. On the end of it's middle finger, it has a pair of eyes and a mouth. It's capable of hovering in a limited fashion to perform certain actions.

`Giant Hand, Size: small, HP: 16(2d6+4), AC: 10, Speed: 30ft, Hover 30ft [16,16,12,8,12,11], Flick +5 1d12 bludgeoning, DC13 STR save or shoved 20ft.`

## Infernoid
Once a humanoid makes a pact for infernal power, they can't go back. The infernal power corrupts, and the contract binds. With each new contract, the humanoid signs over a little more of their humanity. These contracts are most-often negotated at time of death.

1. Devil's eyes: See in regular and magical darkness 120ft
2. Devil's tongue: cast charm person on command.
3. Devil's Wings: Fly speed of 30ft 
4. Mark of Infernal fortitude(bonus action, 1/day): Gain 3d12 temporary hit points
5. Infernal Hide: AC increases to 14. Resistant to fire.
6. Devil's Tail: cast invisibility on command.

## Arch Fey
These are the most powerful fey, not only in their command of fey magic, but also in their scheming.

Needlenose + Giant Leech + Floating Eye

## Needlenose
These up-right creatures are covered in hardened green scales, and though they have gills that allow them to breathe underwater, they are capable of living fully on land without issue. They are named by their three foot long proboscis which opens in three segments and reveals a very long spiky tongue that they can use to pith the insides of their victims. These creatures are feral, gathering in large nests, where they drag the corpses of their victims. When needlenoses consume the brains of their victims, they gain a temporary intelligence boost and become sentient for 24 hours, inheriting the memories of their victims. Generally, one or only a handful of needlenoses will remain intelligent, orchestrating their nests to provide them with a steady stream of brains to feast on.

`Needlenose, Size: large, HP: 28(2d12+4), AC: 14, Speed: 30ft, 30ft swim [16,11,15,5,10,3], Beak +3 2d8+3 piercing`
- Brain Pith: Target one grappled creature. DC 14 STR save, or they take 4d8+3 piercing damage. If this kills the creature, the needlenose consumes their brain and gains an intelligence of 12 for the next 24 hours.

## Floating Eye
It's unclear how this creature emerged, except that wild magic corruption was involved. It is an eye capable of floating with a myriad of pink tentacles hanging from it like that of a jellyfish. Inexplicably, it can produce a beam attack from it's pupil.

`Floating Eye, Size: small, HP: 8(1d6+2), AC: 10, Speed: Fly 30ft [10,10,12,12,7,15], Claws +5 2d6+3 slashing, `
- Charge beam: The eye's iris glows golden. Next turn it may make a beam attack.
- Beam: A 5ft wide, 100ft long beam of golden light blasts forth. All creatures in it's path must succeed a DC 11 DEX save to halve 3d6 radiant damage.

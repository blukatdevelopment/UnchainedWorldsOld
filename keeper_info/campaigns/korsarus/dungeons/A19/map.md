## Giant Ant
Giant ants work in service of a queen.

## Giant Ant Queen
Scholars believe that giant ants are not originally from this world. The queens dominate the telepathic hivemind of their colonies and exhibit a greater amount of intelligence than most wild creatures. Their strong telepathic abilities as well as their ability to mimic humanoid emotions makes them particularly dangerous, as they may telepathically take the form of a humanoid women to diplomatically pacify their targets. Queens are immobile and vulnerable when they are in the process of laying eggs. If the ant queen's avatar is targeted by attacks that deal psychic damage, the queen takes this damage directly, even if using a giant ant as a conduit.

Mantis Man + Stone Scurrier + Imp

## Mantis Man
During the Titan wars powerful weapons unleashed great wild magic corruption onto the land, and the Mantis Men are a product of this, ascending from common mantises. They are capable of non-verbal communication among one another, but are violently territorial toward non-mantises.

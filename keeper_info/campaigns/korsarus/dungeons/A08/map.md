## Sentinel
A partially biological weapon that outlived it's use in the Titan wars.

Their face visor displays a glowing image of their face, and opens to allow them to eat. Some Sentinels have overcome their original programming, but most in the wild are still seeking out and killing any armed humanoids they encounter.

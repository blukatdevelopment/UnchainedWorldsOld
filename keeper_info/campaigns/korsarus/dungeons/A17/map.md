## Floating Eye
It's unclear how this creature emerged, except that wild magic corruption was involved. It is an eye capable of floating with a myriad of pink tentacles hanging from it like that of a jellyfish. Inexplicably, it can produce a beam attack from it's pupil.

`Floating Eye, Size: small, HP: 8(1d6+2), AC: 10, Speed: Fly 30ft [10,10,12,12,7,15], Claws +5 2d6+3 slashing, `
- Charge beam: The eye's iris glows golden. Next turn it may make a beam attack.
- Beam: A 5ft wide, 100ft long beam of golden light blasts forth. All creatures in it's path must succeed a DC 11 DEX save to halve 3d6 radiant damage.

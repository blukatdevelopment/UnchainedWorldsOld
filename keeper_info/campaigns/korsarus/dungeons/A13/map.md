## Muckbeast
This creature resembles a mass of mud with two human eyes and a gaping mouth. It's organs float freely within it's amorphous physiology, containing a layer of protection against it's heavily biodegrading mud-like muck. Muckbeasts can be found in swamps, but also wherever large amounts of decaying organic matter can be found, such as dumps, sewers, and battlefields littered with bodies.

`Muckbeast, Size: large, HP: 33(3d12+9), AC: 10, Speed: 15ft [12,8,16,3,7,3], Smother +5 3d6+3 necrotic`
- Biodegrading muck: Organic matter such as wood that touches the creature is quickly eaten away, destroying weapons such as spears and clubs used against it. An organic creature that touches the muckbeast takes 1d8 necrotic damage.
- Much stream(recharge 5-6): The muckbeast heaves and spews muck onto one creature within 10ft. If the creature is organic, it must make a DC 13 CON save to halve 3d6 necrotic damage.

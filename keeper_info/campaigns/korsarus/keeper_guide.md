## Wound table
When a character goes down and would die due to lacking stamina dice, they may instead take a wound and remain stable, but unconscious. A wound can be healed with Greater Restoration or equivalent, but not normal magical healing. Add this to the character sheet as if it's a feat. Roll a D6. 
1. Internal organ damage: -3 CON
2. Muscle damage: -3 STR
3. Lose arm
4. Lose an eye: -3 WIS
5. Lose leg: -15ft speed and one arm used by crutch. -5ft instead with prosthetic leg.
6. No wound. Remain unconscious for 24 hours, can't be awakened by healing.

## Major Cities

### Korsarus City
Established where the Dragon's Tears meets Viktor's Bay, Korsarus City served as the original foothold in the region for the kingdom of Omaria during the closing days of the Age of Dragons and quickly became a hub of trade and Westward expansion. The city has grown twice, since the first walls were erected, with the outer-most walls being heavily reinforced and guarded in order to ward off giant attacks and protect against invasion. It's estimated the city contains as many as 30,000 residents, and no fewer than 25,0000. Unlicensed use of magic is strictly forbidden within city walls.

#### The Copper Ring
Nearly ten miles separate the the outer walls from the second layer. Most residents can be found by the gates to the Silver Ring, where foreign traders come to trade. These crowded areas run rampant with the poor from near and far, and are heavily polluted by connections with the Silver Ring's sewers. On the East-most of the Copper Ring are docks teeming with merchant ships. The remainder of the ring is host to scattered homesteads that provide the area with the bulk of it's domestic grain, game, and meat. The copper ring is teeming with soots.
Locations of note:
- Workshop Row: raw materials enter this line of structures, and finished goods leave. It is dirty and dangerous work, with occasional accidents causing fires and explosions.
- Stadium: This is where the army trains, public executions are held, and where royals host games for the public.
- Steamworks: This is where the sewage and steam infrastructure that run throughout the walls and silver ring are fueled, pumped, and otherwise maintained. Though it is illegal to enter the sewers, guards are reluctant to enter in order to eject those squatting or doing shady business inside. HQ of the thieves' guild.
- Docks: Even more crime-ridden than the slums, a great deal of wealth stands to be made from seabound merchants, legal or otherwise.
- The fields: Omaria's alternative to indoor prisons. Those not executed are sent to work out their sentences on royal farms.
- The claw: Sprawling slums largely inhabited by migrant beastfolk.
- Sanctuary: A place where temples pool their charity efforts. There's an abundance of free housing, orphanages, and temples for the poor.
- Copper Market: This is where Korsarans get their first chance to purchase goods destined for the Merchant's Mile.
- Fortitude Rock: This is where new recruits are quartered and trained, as well as a staging ground for operations in the giant's playground.
- Ferry House: A small port for riverbound vessels to stop at.

##### Common knowledge
Every commoner in the slums of the copper ring knows these things:
- A loaf of bread costs 2 copper, mug of ale costs 4 copper, and a day's pay is 1 silver 
- Omaria sends thieves to the fields and those who use magic to the stadium
- The Omarian scouts keep the giants from reaching the outer walls
- The templegoers in Sanctuary are exempt from magic laws
- There are artifacts in scattered ruins worth hundreds or thousands of gold
- You need to show 100 gold and an ID card(or a bribe) to enter the Silver Ring
- The Omarian Militia, Thieves' Guild, and adventurer companies pay out well to survivors
- The monsters outside the walls have very valuable bodyparts
- The docks bring in people from all over the world
- It only takes a day to reach Thiersgar by boat, but 5gp for a ticket

#### The Silver Ring
To enter the walls of the silver ring, one must have an identification card and 100 gold pieces on them. Those caught tresspassing are generally arrested and sent off to work in the fields. The land is primarily home to coggers and bronzehammers.
Locations of note:
- Merchant's Mile: Fine crafted goods and imports from around the world can be found in the myriad shops. Additionally, theaters, spas, healers, inns, and fine restaurants can be found in great abundance. 
- Temple District: Temples of many popular divines of the region can be found here.
- Academy: Founded by dragon slayers during the Great Slaying, then used as an outpost by the Titans, it now serves as headquarters for Omaria's military police.
- Tiny Town: Several city blocks made to a scale only traversible by tinyfolk. Tinkering work  is done here for the workshop rows.

#### The Gold Core
The inner sanctum of Korsarus City, the Gold Core is home to nobility and royalty. One must either be of noble blood, or else enter into the gold core under the honor of a noble, who takes personal responsibility for their honored guest. The Omarian army patrols the Gold Core, and tresspassing is a deadly offense. Residents of the gold core are exclusively Gold Robes, with even most hired help also donning robes of a thin gold hem.
Locations of note:
- Cathedral of Bimros: Built at the height of the Empire of Man.
- University
- Castle Omaria: Features the skull of the dragon the castle was originally built for.
- Various Mansions: Each noble or royal family has a mansion in the Gold Core. 

##### University
Built originally as a library in the early dragon age, it has since become a walled sanctuary for mages of all sorts.
It has a few landmarks of it's own.

- Shimmering towers: Towers for residence, lecture halls, shops, and faculty
- Power Dome: pumps mana over the university for magical practice. Looks like a tesla coil in a metal dome cage.
- Growhouse: self-contained ecosystems of desert, jungle, polar, and wild
- Stacks: Public libraries with safe knowledge
- Archives: Disorganized and uncurated
- Student services: Student jail
- The pound: Magical prison for magical prisoners
- Titan Reserve: island of ruined Titan armor and dragon skulls with boulder inscribed with "Overlords no more"
- Proving Grounds: Study of lost tech
- Bloodfield: Field for duels, sporting events




### Thiersgar
A town of nearly 5,000, Thiersgar is the drop-off point for nearby smaller settlements bringing their goods down the Dragon's Tears River to Korsarus City. The river provides natural protection against giants in addition to the city's walls. Ore, coal, lumber, textiles, ice, and meat provide bountiful opportunities for trade with Korsarus City. While the town's artisans convert raw resources into value-added goods, the city serves as the furthest stronghold of Omarian expansion in the region. Warlords, bandits, and monsters are routinely brought down by Omarian scouts here, in exchange for material tribute. Field Folk are most common in and around Thiersgar, with most businesses well used to providing service to friendly giants. Wayfarers are also common in the area, acting as the main source of trade for many of the smaller communities dotting the surrounding land. Lastly, Bronzehammers can be found smelting ores into ingots and leading mining expeditions into the mountains.
Locations of note:
- Courthouse: matters of law and local diplomacy are settled here.
- Graveyard: The mass graves of the Age of Dragons and Titan Age have been re-used for marked graves. It is home to many mausoleums and tombs.

### Arcanus
Built on the scars, a desert dotted with ruins of a Titan metropolis, Arcanus is protected by a shimmering purple energy shield. Inside, a crumbling infrastructure of Titan lost tech continues to hum and keep the city afloat with the aid of a small army of tech priests and mages. The city is independent from Omaria, and has held it's own by a policy of isolationism. The final breakdown of Arcanus has been predicted several times, each time ending with new scavenging sites offering promise of repairing or maintaining the city's lost tech. The Silent, Coggers, and Wild Folk make up the brunt of the Arcanus population. 
Locations of note:
- Techpriest Cathedral: Home to the shield generator, a food replicator, and a graveyard of other machines in various states of resurrection.
- Scav market: Those that return from scavenging missions bring their salvage here to trade it for goods and services of both a mundane and fantastical nature.
- Bunker town: beneath the ground, a bunker made by the titans has been converted into housing for most of the city's residents. This is where all agriculture in Arcanus can be found, inside special arcane farms.

### Shadowvale
The swamps and walking trees of the blightlands provide a natural defense that makes Omarian invasion all but impossible, and so Shadowvale enjoys complete independence. Deep Folk, Greenfoot people, and Wild Folk thrive in this region off of locally sourced food, fuel, and building materials. A Gold Robe family of vampires that founded the town remains in power, keeping the competing interests of the various residents in check. Many who would otherwise be shunned or killed on sight, such as sorcerers, necromancers, and devils are welcome inside the city, provided they behave themselves during their stay.
Locations of note:
- Von Otvos Keep: A home of the wealthy vampire families that rule over the town. It was untouched since the beginning of the dragon age
- Fey Grove: A greenfoot community where sunlight is constant, allowing traditional agriculture not possible in the blightlands.
- Market Square: A meeting place for the disparate peoples of Shadowvale.
- Revolutionary base: A key meeting place and sanctuary for the various Wild Folk causes.
- Tunnels: Subterranean tunnels run deep through the region, teeming with rare monsters.

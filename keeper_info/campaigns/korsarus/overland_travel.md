# Overland travel
Why not just say "You're traveling from X to Y, which will take Z days. Roll for an encounter each day." and call it good? Simply put, I want traveling Korsarus to seem treacherous, dangerous, and ripe for discovery.

## Water
An adventurer drinks 1 gallon a day, and a horse or mule drinks 5. When you find a watersource, you can refill all containers.
One or more members of the party may expend a stamina die to search for water, each making a survival check with DC varying by terrain. On a success, the party locates water that day.

## Food
An adventurer eats 2 pounds of food, while a mount eats 5 pounds of food when they cannot graze on vegetation. One or more members of the party may expend a stamina die to forage or hunt, making a survival check to determine how many pounds of fresh rations they find. Foraged food requires a DC 12(or passive 10) nature check, made in secret, to determine if it is safe to eat.

## Rest
When you rest, you regain stamina dice according to the number of amenities present. It's adviseable to bring along tents, bedrolls, axes, and tinderboxes to allow setting up camp for the night. Dry Bedding, Fire and shelter, and Food and water should restore three stamina dice nightly. Doubling food rations or uncorking a fine wine may add additional stamina in a pinch.

## Pace
You may move at full pace by exhausting 2 stamina dice, at half pace by exhausting 1 stamina die, or remain stationary for the day at no cost of stamina dice.

## Terrain
Roads are easiest to travel. Traveling off of the road in fair terrain such as grassy fields or sparse woodlands exhausts an extra stamina die per day of travel. Travelling off the road in hostile terrain such as dense forests, jungles, deserts, or mountains exhausts an extra two stamina dice per day of travel.

## Complications
When an adventurer has less stamina dice than is required during traveling, they are incapable of attending to all finer details, and might mistakes.

## Discovery
Every day of travel in a given hex, the keeper rolls a 1d6 and a 1d20. On a 6, the party stumbles onto a landmark. On a 20, the party stumbles onto a hidden location which may be easy to miss. One navigator may lead the party back to a previously discovered landmark with a DC12(or passive 10) Survival check or to a hidden location with a DC 15(or passive 13) survival check.

## Encounters
The keeper rolls a 1d6, and on a 1 some form of encounter is present. An adventurer may expend one stamina die to go ahead of the group and scout, granting advantage on any checks involved in detecting creatures or objects involved with the encounter.

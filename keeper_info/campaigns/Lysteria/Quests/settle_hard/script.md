# Settle, and settle hard
There's a new contract posted by a group of fed-up farmers looking to migrate South to the Silent Woods, where they can be away from the constant turmoil of Northern struggle. They are requesting adventurers to escort them, as they've heard there's beaked bears in the region.

## Random encounter table
If they eat a ration, they move three spaces. If they forage, they move one
space. Half-way, add +1 bonus to 1d6 roll. Three quarters, add a +2 instead.
Every day, there is a 1d6 chance of an encounter.

some followup questions to each party member, complimenting them.

Bartram Beton will offer to play viola for the group, which will cause the 
caravan to engage in line dancing.

Martin Shotbolt will challenge the most confident character to a dancing
contest. Should they win, he'll give them his hat. But he wants something
of equal value for sale.

The first morning of the trip, the party will run into a stagwich patrol
consisting of 10 soldiers.

are occupied by stagwich troops, but they need another horse to get the 
caravan moving again. When they get back to the caravan, a couple stagwich
soldiers will be at the caravan, waiting. A DC 12 nature or medicine check will
reveal the horse appears to have been poisoned.

## Ambush (Setback)
The very next night, the party will celebrate their survival with wine. Bartram
will play the viola again, and people will fall into dancing. If anyone in the
party drinks the wine, they will need to make a DC 13 con save. On a failure, 
they will pass out. Another watch of 10 soldiers will arrive at that time.

## Caravan's fate (Climax)
The party is now faced with a moral dillemma. The caravan is destined for the
woods, where there may be owl bears. The caravan has traitors who tried to
get the party killed, but they will plead not only for their lives, but for
safe passage, as their children need somewhere safe to live.

## Owlbear (Revelation)
If the party makes it to the silent woods, they will find the owl bears, which
are roughly the size of overgrown rats. They make squeak sounds, and move in
herds, hunting smaller critters and insects.

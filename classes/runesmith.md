## Feataures

### Runebook
You have a book of runes for your spells. You start with two cantrips and three 1st level spells from the
runesmith spell list and may add additional spells.

#### Copying Spells
You may copy spells from a spellbook or scroll if they are on the runesmith spell list. For every level
of the spell you are copying, you require one hour of time and 10GP of paper, inks, and materials. WHen
you gain subsequent levels, you may learn one spell from the spell list at no cost.

### Runesmithery
You've practiced with runes and can now carve them into flat stones during a partial rest. During a partial rest,
you may inscribe stones with the runes of a particular spell. Each rune you carve requires 2 silver pieces
worth of materials needed to make arcane ink. The number of runes you may have active at any time can be 
found in the runes column for your level. A runestone containing a second level spell will require two runes,
a third level spell will require three runes, and so on. A runestone with a single rune on it may contain
four copies of the same cantrip spell.

### Runecasting
When holding a rune stone in your hand, you may use an action to release the stored spell from the stone.
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability. The rune stone you cast with acts as a spell focus, and is 
consumed after the spell is cast.

### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

### Runecasting technique
Choose one runecasting technique from the runecasting techniques section below.

## Runecasting techniques
When you gain a runecasting technique, you may choose from these options.

### Remote Runecasting
You have learned to release a spell stored in a rune from a distance. This distance increases when
you reach levels 6 and 8. The spell is centered on the rune stone, and cannot target a creature if
doing so involves an attack roll.

```
+-------+----------+
| Level | Distance |
+-------+----------+
|     4 | 30ft     |
|     6 | 120ft    |
|     8 | 1 mile   |
+-------+----------+
```

### Rune arrows
You have learned to inscribe runes into stone arrowheads. On impact, the spell stored in a rune
arrow is cast, centered on the arrow or targeting the creature or object that is impacted.

### Elemental Blades
You have learned to inscribe martial runes into blades. Select the damage type of a spell you know.
When you use your action to touch this blade and activate the runes, the blade is imbued with 
this element. For the next minute, attacks with this blade have double the damage dice. The extra 
dice deal the selected damage type. THe cost in runes is shown below.

```
+-----------+-----------------------+
| Rune cost |        Weapons        |
+-----------+-----------------------+
|         2 | Sickle, dagger        |
|         4 | Shortsword, Longsword |
|         6 | Greatsword            |
+-----------+-----------------------+
```

### Armor Runes
You learn to inscribe runes into medium and heavy armor for spells that target a creature.
Each spell inscribed this way requires twice the normal number of runes. When you use your action 
to touch the piece of armor and cast one of it's inscribed spells, you do not need to concentrate 
on that spell. You may have multiple effects active at one time by casting this way.

### Everrunes
You have learned to carve runes that are not destroyed when they are cast. Instead, such a rune expends
it's magical energy and requires an additional 6 seconds to recharge. Choose three cantrips from the
runesmith spell list and add them to your runebook. You may choose a cantrip to prepare an everrune.
Creating a primitive everrune requires 4 runes, which are not restored on a long rest until the everrune
is dismissed with an action.

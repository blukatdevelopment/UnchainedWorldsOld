## Feataures

### Runebook
You have a book of runes for your spells. You start with two cantrips and three 1st level spells from the
runesmith spell list and may add additional spells.

#### Copying Spells
You may copy spells from a spellbook or scroll if they are on the runesmith spell list. For every level
of the spell you are copying, you require one hour of time and 10GP of paper, inks, and materials. WHen
you gain subsequent levels, you may learn one spell from the spell list at no cost.

### Runesmithery
You've practiced with runes and can now carve them into flat stones during a partial rest. During a partial rest,
you may inscribe stones with the runes of a particular spell. Each rune you carve requires 2 silver pieces
worth of materials needed to make arcane ink. The number of runes you may have active across all your rune stones
at any time can be found in the runes column for your level. A runestone containing a second level spell will
require two runes, a third level spell will require three runes, and so on. A runestone with a single rune on it
may contain four copies of the same cantrip spell.

### Runecasting
When holding a rune stone in your hand, you may use an action to release the stored spell from the stone.
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability. The rune stone you cast with acts as a spell focus, and is 
consumed after the spell is cast.

### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

### Runecasting Style
When you reach 4th level, you define your style for the rest of your career.

#### Spell Hoarder
You have an insatiable appetite for spellcasting, and you are constantly reading
through the literature. You learn an extra spell, and each time you level up from
now on you may learn one additional spell.

#### Rune Hoarder
Your runes are made with a special, more expensive technique that is less
taxing to your magical energy. As such, you may smith a number of additional
runes equal to your intelligence modifier plus your proficiency bonus. Your
runes now cost 5 silver to produce, instead of 2.

#### Cantrip Savant
You have learned to smith new cantrip runes that can be invoked endlessly.
Such a rune requires 5 gold pieces to smith.

#### Rune Artisan
You have learned to smith advanced rune stones. Each time you carve runes onto a
rune stone, you may carve an additional rune to smith an artisinal rune stone
with one of the following properties:
- Upcast - The spell is cast as if from two levels higher.
- Blast - If the spell deals damage, you may reroll the the damage and choose the highest.
- Guided - If this spell involves one or more spell attacks, they are made with advantage.
- Surge - If the spell forces targets to make a saving throw, they must make it with disadvantage.
- Remote - This rune can be invoked from a range of up to 1 mile. Ranged spells that target a point select the runestone's position, or select a random target within range if they target a creature.

### Runesmithing Technique
When you reach 7th level, you learn one of the following techniques.

#### Cantrip Ammunition
When you craft a cantrip that deals damage, you may instead craft four pieces of
cantrip ammunition. Cantrip ammunition is fired as part of a ranged attack, and
it's effect takes place on impact. Cantrips that require saving throws still
require those same saving throws.

#### Spell Armor
You may carve runes on pieces of heavy armor in order to stores spell in them.
When the wearer speaks a command word, the spell activates, targeting the
wearer if the range is self or touch. The cost in runes for a spell carved
on armor is double.

#### Spell Blade
You may carve runes on blades in order to store spells in them. The spell must
target a creature with an attack roll or spell save. The next time the blade
hits a creature, the spell hits the creature. If the creature needed to make
a saving throw, they automatically fail it. A spell blade takes twice as many
runes as a normal rune stone.

### Runecasting Style
When you reach 9th level, you may select one additional runecasting style that
you did not select at 4th level.

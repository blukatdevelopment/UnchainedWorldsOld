## Feataures

### Runebook
You have a book of runes for your spells. You start with two cantrips and three 1st level spells from the
runesmith spell list and may add additional spells.

#### Copying Spells
You may copy spells from a spellbook or scroll if they are on the runesmith spell list. For every level
of the spell you are copying, you require one hour of time and 10GP of paper, inks, and materials. WHen
you gain subsequent levels, you may learn one spell from the spell list at no cost.

### Runesmithery
You've practiced with runes and can now carve them into flat stones during a long rest. During a long rest,
you may inscribe stones with the runes of a particular spell. Each rune you carve requires 2 silver pieces
worth of materials needed to make arcane ink. The number of runes you may have active at any time can be 
found in the runes column for your level. A runestone containing a second level spell will require two runes,
a third level spell will require three runes, and so on. A runestone with a single rune on it may contain
four copies of the same cantrip spell.

### Runecasting
When holding a rune stone in your hand, you may use an action to release the stored spell from the stone.
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability. The rune stone you cast with acts as a spell focus, and is 
consumed after the spell is cast.

### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

### Runecasting technique
Choose one runecasting technique from the runecasting techniques section below.

## Runecasting techniques
When you gain a runecasting technique, you may choose from these options.

### Remote Runecasting
You have learned to release a spell stored in a rune from a distance. This distance increases when
you reach levels 6 and 8. The spell is centered on the rune stone, and cannot target a creature if
doing so involves an attack roll.

```
+-------+----------+
| Level | Distance |
+-------+----------+
|     4 | 30ft     |
|     6 | 120ft    |
|     8 | 1 mile   |
+-------+----------+
```

### Rune arrows
You have learned to inscribe runes into stone arrowheads. On impact, the spell stored in a rune
arrow is cast, centered on the arrow or targeting the creature or object that is impacted.

### Elemental Blades
You have learned to inscribe martial runes into blades. Select the damage type of a spell you know.
When you use your action to touch this blade and activate the runes, the blade is imbued with 
this element. For the next minute, attacks with this blade have double the damage dice. The extra 
dice deal the selected damage type. THe cost in runes is shown below.

```
+-----------+-----------------------+
| Rune cost |        Weapons        |
+-----------+-----------------------+
|         2 | Sickle, dagger        |
|         4 | Shortsword, Longsword |
|         6 | Greatsword            |
+-----------+-----------------------+
```

### Armor Runes
You learn to inscribe runes into medium and heavy armor for spells that target a creature.
Each spell inscribed this way requires twice the normal number of runes. When you use your action 
to touch the piece of armor and cast one of it's inscribed spells, you do not need to concentrate 
on that spell. You may have multiple effects active at one time by casting this way.

### Everrunes
You have learned to carve runes that are not destroyed when they are cast. Instead, such a rune expends
it's magical energy and requires an additional 6 seconds to recharge. Choose three cantrips from the
runesmith spell list and add them to your runebook. You may choose a cantrip to prepare an everrune.
Creating a primitive everrune requires 4 runes, which are not restored on a long rest until the everrune
is dismissed with an action.

weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.

Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

### Mage Hand (cantrip)
Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 feet
Componentss: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)
Duration: 1 round

hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood 
blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or 
through openings.

else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no 
larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. 
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an 
illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature 
discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

its next turn.

creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that 
won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on 
to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the 
remaining total for that creature to be affected.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 
2d10 for each slot level above 1st.

### Comprehend Languages (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M ( a pinch of soot and salt)
Duration: 1 hour
For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand 
any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes 
about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn't decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a 
written language.

### Detect Magic (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you 
can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, 
and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin 
sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.


### Disguise Self (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different 
until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can 
appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same 
basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to 
add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would 
feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches 
out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on 
an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

### Distort Value (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V
Duration: 8 hours
Do you need to squeeze a few more gold pieces out of a merchant as you try to sell that weird octopus statue you 
liberated from the chaos temple? Do you need to downplay the worth of some magical assets when the tax collector 
stops by? Distort value has you covered.

You cast this spell on an object no more than 1 foot on a side, doubling the object's perceived value by adding 
illusory flourishes or polish to it, or reducing its perceived value by half with the help of illusory scratches, 
dents, and other unsightly features. Anyone examining the object can ascertain its true value with a successful 
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum size of the object 
increases by 1 foot for each slot level above 1st.

### Earth Tremor (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the ground in 
that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion 
requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 
1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

### Expeditious Retreat (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
This spell allows you to move at an incredible pace. When you cast this spell, and then as a bonus action on 
each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take the Dash action.

### False Life (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M ( a small amount of alcohol or distilled spirits)
Duration: 1 hour
Bolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional 
temporary hit points for each slot level above 1st.

### Feather Fall (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, M (a small feather or a piece of down)
Duration: 1 minute
Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per 
round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can 
land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.

### Find Familiar (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)
Duration: Instantaneous
You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad),
 hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing
 in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial,
 fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.

Additional animal form choices may be available at the DM's discretion.

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative
 and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast
 this spell again.

While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action,
 you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits
 of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your 
summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to 
reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead 
cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. 
Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the 
spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

### Fog Cloud (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area 
is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 
feet for each slot level above 1st.

### Frost Fingers (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (15-foot cone)
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Freezing cold blasts from your fingertips in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw,
 taking 2d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The cold freezes nonmagical liquids in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot
level above 1st.

### Grease (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M(a bit of pork rind or butter)
Duration: 1 minute
Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature
that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

### Ice Knife (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: S, M(a drop of water or piece of ice)
Duration: Instantaneous

You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. 
On a hit, the target takes 1d10 piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature 
within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 cold damage.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases 
by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

### Identify (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl feather)
Duration: Instantaneous
You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some
other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to 
use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they 
are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

### Jump (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a grasshopper's hind leg)
Duration: 1 minute
You touch a creature. The creature's jump distance is tripled until the spell ends.

### Longstrider (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M ( a pinch of dirt)
Duration: 1 hour
You touch a creature. The target's speed increases by 10 feet until the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one 
additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

### Mage Armor (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)
Duration: 8 hours
You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until 
the spell ends. The target's base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target 
dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

### Magic Missile  (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can 
see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, 
and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates 
one more dart for each slot level above 1st.

### Protection From Good and Evil (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: 
aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against 
the target. The target also can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, 
frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

### Ray of Sickness (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack 
against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. 
On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases 
by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

### Shield (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell
Range: self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round
An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a
+5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.

### Silent Image (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot 
cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't 
accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you 
can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image 
of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature 
that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence 
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature
can see through the image.

### Sleep (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)
Duration: 1 minute
This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this 
spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of 
their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls 
unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper 
awake. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit 
points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by this spell.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 
for each slot level above 1st.

### Snare (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: S, M (25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes)
Duration: 8 hours
As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When 
you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save 
DC to be discerned.

The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell's radius. 
That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside 
down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.

A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself 
on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence 
(Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.

After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it.

### Caustic Brew (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: self (30-foot line)
Components: V, S, M ( a bit of rotten food)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A stream of acid emanates from you in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature 
in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for the spell's duration or until a 
creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A creature covered in the acid 
takes 2d4 acid damage at start of each of its turns.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 
for each slot level above 1st.

### Hideous Laughter (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the air)
Duration: Concentration, up to a minute
A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits 
of laughter if this spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated 
and unable to stand up for the duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't affected.

At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. 
The target has advantage on the saving throw if it's triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.

### Floating Disk (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)
Duration: 1 hour
This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above 
the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and 
can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.

The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows 
you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, 
but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, 
nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

### Thunderwave (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (15-foot cube)
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, 
the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you 
by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each 
slot level above 1st.

### Unseen Servant (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M ( a piece of string and a bit of wood)
Duration: 1 hour
This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell 
ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a 
Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.

Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an 
object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding 
clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of 
its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

### Witch Bolt (1st level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a twig from a tree that has been struck by lightning)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and 
the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your 
turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use 
your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 for 
each slot level above 1st.

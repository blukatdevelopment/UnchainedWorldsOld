difference, and it is unclear whether you will ever meet someone
similarly-minded.

## Features


### Invisible Hand
When you concentrate, you can can use your action to conjure force in the form
of an invisible hand. This hand has a range of 30 feet and can lift no more 
than 10lb. The hand can be active for up to one minute.

#### From higher levels
When cast as a first level spell, the range increases to 60 feet, it can carry
50lb, and you may attack with it to deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage. Wisdom is
the ability used for melee attacks with your invisible hand.

When cast as a second level spell, the hand can carry 100lb, grapple, shove, or
drag creatures(make a spellcheck in lieu of athletics checks). Attack damage 
increases to 1d6 bludgeoning and you can wield one-handed melee weapons with it.

When cast as a third level spell, the hand can carry 300lb, grapple or shove
large creatures two sizes larger than you, and it deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage.

### Silent Voice
You focus on one creature within 120 feet of you and spend your action sending
a message to it no longer than 6 seconds. The creature perceives this message
in your language, and may reply with a message no longer than 6 seconds.

#### From higher levels
When cast as a first level spell, you may send your message to up to two
creatures instead of one. The range increase to 240 feet.

When cast as a second level spell, you may send your message to up to three
creatures instead of one, you communicate through solid objects.

### Psionic Guidance
You draw from your well of mental guidance to creatures within thirty feet of 
you. Either as an action on your turn or as a reaction on another turn, you may 
roll your psionic die as if casting a spell and add the number you rolled to a 
creature’s attack, ability check, skill check, or saving throw.

### Psionic Spellcasting
You have awakened latent abilities. They will grow stronger as you grow further
in tune with yourself. Your spellcasting ability is wisdom. Instead of using 
spell slots to determine the limit of your magical power, you instead use a 
psionic die. At first level, your psionic die is a D2. It increases in size 
according to the “psionic die” column in the psion table. 

#### Using the psionic die
When you cast a spell of first or higher level, you roll a number of dice equal
to the spell’s level. If any of these dice roll a 1, your die decreases one 
size. When you roll a 1 on a D2, you can no longer cast spells this way until 
after a long rest. You can cast a spell of a level no higher than half the 
current size of your psionic die. 

#### Spells Known
You know one 1st level spells, and learn one spell each time you gain a level 
in this class. When you gain a level in this class, you may swap out one spell 
with another of the same level.

### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores 
of your choice by 1. You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

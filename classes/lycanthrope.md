## Features

### Lycanthrope Form
Choose from werewolf, wererat, or werebear. There are certain triggers that
will cause you to succeed a wisdom saving throw or transform into this form 
against your will, at which time your primal instincts will overtake your mind
and you will lose control of your actions for 1d4 hours. During this time, the
GM can intermittently or entirely control your actions. All of your lycanthrope
abilities and features are active during an unwilling shift. When you leave your
lycanthrope form from an unwilling shift, you have 1 hit point and your clothing
is damaged according to the extent of your growth during the transformation.

### Controlled Shift
You've learned to control your shift into your beast form. 
You may use your bonus action to willingly transform into your lycanthrope form.
You remain in that state for 1 minute, after which you must make a DC 12 wisdom
saving throw to exit it. If you fail the save, the controlled shift becomes
an uncontrolled shift and lasts for 1d4 hours. You can use this ability a number
of times indicated in the shifts column of the lycanthrope table. You restore
all your shifts on a partial or full rest. As a reaction when an unwilling
shift is triggered, you may expend a shift in order to take control of yourself.

#### Tough hide
You have resistance to non-magical and non-silvered slashing, piercing, and
bludgeoning damage when shifted.

### Extra atack
In addition to any attacks you would normally make when you use the attack
action, you may make one additional attack.

Your size is medium and your speed is 40ft. Your maximum hit points are

attacks gain advantage when made against an enemy within 5ft of an ally that is
not unconscious.

#### Jaws
At level one, you can use your lycanthrope form's natural attacks.
When you make an unarmed attack, you can use your jaws to deal piercing damage
equal to 1d6+strength. 

#### Howl
At level two, you learn to harness the ferocity of your lycanthrope form.
You may use your action to release a bloodcurdling howl, which will trigger
any lycanthropes that can hear you with a DC16 wisdom save, and which will grant
you 1d10 temporary hit points. Any creature within 10 feet of you must succeed a
DC 15 wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the start of your next
turn. Once you use this ability, you may not use it again until your next shift.

#### Incisors
At level one, you can use your lycanthrope form's natural attacks.
When you make an unarmed attack, you can bite down to deal piercing damage equal
to 1d6+strength. When this attack is made with advantage, you deal critical
damage and that enemy cannot make attacks of opportunity against you until the
start of the next turn.

#### Dark vision
At level two, you senses in your lynthrope form are heightened.
In darkness you can see 30 feet as if bright light, and for 30 more feet as if
in dim light. You cannot see colors this way. Dim light appears as bright light
to you. You receive disadvantage on attacks and ability or skill checks made 
when exposed to sunlight.

#### Unnatural Mobility
At level two, you learn to harness the agility of your form.
You may use your bonus action to perform the dash, dodge, or hide actions.

#### Fury swipes
At level four, you learn to channel your fury into a series of slashes.
When both hands are free, you may use your action to swipe 1d4 times.
You use your dexterity modifier for these attacks, and they deal slashing damage
equal to 1d4+dexterity.

### Werebear

#### Powerful physique
At level one, you can transform into your lycanthrope form.
Your size is large and your movement is 25ft. Your maximum hit points are 
recalculated with your hit die size changed to 1d12. Athletics checks and 
constitution saving throws are made with advantage. When you take the attack 
action, you may attack one extra time.

#### Claws

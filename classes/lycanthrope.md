## Features

### Lycanthrope Form
Choose from werewolf, wererat, or werebear. There are certain triggers that
will cause you to succeed a wisdom saving throw or transform into this form 
against your will, at which time your primal instincts will overtake your mind
and you will lose control of your actions for 1d4 hours. During this time, the
GM can intermittently or entirely control your actions. All of your lycanthrope
abilities and features are active during an unwilling shift. When you leave your
lycanthrope form, you have 1 hit point and your clothing is damaged according to
the extent of your growth during the transformation.

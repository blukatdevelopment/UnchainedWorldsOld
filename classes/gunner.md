Maybe you dispatch your enemies from a secure vantage point, draw at
high noon, or bring down buildings. You're a master of steel, lead,

tip of the spear in military innovation.

## Maneuvers

### Humanoid shield
When you grapple a creature and are targeted by a ranged weapon or spell attack,
you may use your reaction to add +5 to your AC for the purpose of that attack.
If the attack would have otherwise hit you, the grappled creature receives this
hit instead.

### Execution
When you are within 5ft of an enemy that does not see you, your expertise with
gunning allows you to aim to kill. You may make a ranged weapon attack without
receiveving disadvantage from close range. If this attack hits, you deal an
additional 3d8 damage.

### Spray and Pray
If firing a weapon with the reload property, you may use your action to make
up to three ranged attacks in place of one. Each attack has disadvantage.

### Fire around cover
You've learned to blindly fire from behind cover. When you are behind cover
from an enemy, you may hold your weapon out of cover and attack with it. When
doing so, you receive a -5 to your attack roll. Making an attack this way does
not expose you to enemy ranged attacks.

### Disarming shot
You're as precise as you are quick. If an enemy is holding an item of any kind
in one hand, you may target the item in their hand, incurring a -5 penalty to
your attack roll when you do so. On a hit, the target lets go of the item. If
it is not attached to them in some way, it falls to the ground.

### Called shot
You target a specific body part such as a leg, arm, hand, or eye. At the DM's
discretion, this attack receives either a -2 or -5 penalty to the attack roll.
On a hit, your damage is applied directly to that body part. This may effect
a creature's mobility, senses, or deal an additional 1d8 damage by targeting
a vital body part.

### Quick draw
If you are targeted by a ranged weapon attack and your hands are empty, you may
use your reaction to draw a holstered one-handed ranged weapon and make a ranged
weapon attack with it. You may not quick draw weapons that are already drawn, or
that are not in a holster of some sort.

### Steady Aim
You're good at getting the most out of long barrels. With any two-handed
ranged weapon, you may use your bonus action to aim carefully. Doing so grants
your next shot this turn advantage.

### Dual-wielding
You've learned to wield ranged weapons with both hands. The weapons must be
one-handed. If one or more of the weapons have the reloading property, you must
use an action on the next turn to reload both weapons.

### Trigger Guard Catch
When a blade(dagger, shortsword, longsword, rapier) targets you with an attack
that would hit, you may use your reaction to gain +2 AC for the purpose of this
attack by catching the blade in the trigger guard of a weapon that has one 
(pistol, revolver, hand crossbow). If this blocks the attack, you each may 
attempt to wrestle the entangled weapons free from the other by making your 
choice of an athletics or acrobatics check. Whoever succeeds retains their
weapon and knocks their opponent's weapon onto the ground.

### Bayonet
On a two-handed crossbow or firearm, you may now install a shortsword as a
bayonet. When wielding a weapon equipped with a bayonet, you are able to defend
against approaching enemies. When a creature that you can see enters a range of
10 feet of you, you may use your reaction to make an melee attack at them.
This attack uses your strength modifier and deals 1d8 piercing damage on a
hit.

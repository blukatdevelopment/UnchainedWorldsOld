## Features

### Thieve's Cant
Your thieving lifestyle has lead you to learn the language thieves use to communicate by subtle gestures and markings left on buildings and objects. You may use these to locate criminal contacts.

### Expertise
Choose one skill that you have proficiency with. Your proficiency bonus counts twice for checks made with this skill. You may substitute this skill proficiency for proficiency with thieve's tools.

### Cunning Action
You may use your bonus action to perform the Dash, Dodge, Disengage, or Hide actions.

### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

### Second-Story Work
You gain a climbing speed equal to half your movement speed. Fall damage from 20 feet or less is halved for you.

### Fast Hands
You may now use your bonus action to perform sleight of hand checks, use your thieves' tools to
disarm a trap, open a lock, or take the Use An Object action.

### Reactive Dodge
When an attack targets you, you may now use your reaction to give that attack disadvantage.

### Flight Of Foot
Adrenaline pumps through your veins and you feel faster than normal. For this turn, your speed
doubles. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

### Superior Sneak
You gain advantage on a stealth check if you have moved no more than half your speed on the same
turn.

### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

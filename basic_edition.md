# Foreword
This ruleset is stripped down, hyper-minimilist version of the unchained worlds
system. You can run in and play unchained worlds modules using these basic rules
by using the provided rules and allowing your table's keeper to adjudicate in
instances of uncertainty.

# Creating your character

## Abilities
- Strength: Lift, climb, carry, grapple, throw, punch, and perform tasks that require brute force.
- Dexterity: Sprint, jump, duck, dodge, sneak, and perform acrobatic Techniques.
- Constitution: Resist the effects of poison, toxins, fatigue, and illness. Determines your maximum hit points.
- Intelligence: Process, calculate, and reason through complex information. 
- Wisdom: Intuit, deduce, and read between the lines. Particularly good for resisting mind-altering magic, reading the intentions of others, and perceiving the world around you.
- Charisma: Joke, flatter, persuade, lie, bluff, perform, and intimidate others. Useful wherever talking or looking good is needed.

### Modifiers
The keeper may ask you to make a check to succeed an attempted action, or a
saving throw to resist negative effects. Roll a 1d20 and add the modifier for
the relevant ability.

```
+-------+----------+
| Score | Modifier |
+-------+----------+
| 20    | +5       |
| 18-19 | +4       |
| 16-17 | +3       |
| 14-15 | +2       |
| 12-13 | +1       |
| 10-11 | 0        |
| 8-9   | -1       |
| 6-7   | -2       |
| 4-5   | -3       |
| 2-3   | -4       |
| 1     | -5       |
+-------+----------+
```

### Generating ability scores
Roll 4d6. Set aside the lowest roll and ignore it. Add up the remaining three. This is your strength score. Repeat this process for the other five abilities. When you’re done, you may switch the scores of two abilities. You may do this only for one pair of abilities.

## Class
You may choose between mage, rogue, or fighter.

### Mage
Mages can use staves and daggers, but cannot wear armor. You start with a
spellbook to store your spells in, a wand to cast spells with, robed common
clothes, 10 torches, 10 days of rations, and 10 gold pieces.

## Additional stats

### Hit points
Hit points represent your physical well-being, reducing when you take damage.
When your hit points fall to 0, you are dead. When you roll your hit points
, you may add your constitution modifier for each die rolled.

### Armor class
When an attack is made, it must meet or exceed the target's armor class(AC) to
hit. See the armor section to determine your AC.

### Carry weight
Carry weight decides how many pounds of stuff you can carry and wear on your
person. Your carry weight is equal to 7 times your strength score. If your
strength score is 10, for instance, you can carry 70 lbs on you.

# Combat
## Initiative
Each combatant rolls a 1d20 and adds their dexterity modifier to the roll. Turn order reflects the roll. On a tie, 
the combatant with the highest dexterity goes first. When a tie remains after comparing dexterity, combatants each roll a 1d20 and the highest
goes first.

## On your turn
On each turn, you receive the following:
- 1 action
- 1 free object interaction(stashing/drawing an item, opening door, talking for 6 seconds, etc)
- 6 paces(5ft each) of movement, which you may spend to move up to 6 paces. You may spend 3 paces to get up from prone position.

### Actions in combat
Using your action, you may perform an intensive task. Some examples:
- attack
- dash: You gain 6 paces of movement
- hide: You may make a DEX check (DC 12) to hide from one or more creatures if your line of sight is broken.
- dodge: You focus on avoiding incoming attacks, adding +5 to your AC
- cast a spell
- Use object

#### Making attacks
Roll a 1d20, then add your Strength(for melee) or Dexterity(for ranged) modifier
to the roll. If that roll is higher than your target's armor class(AC), then it
hits. The keeper keeps track of monster stats, and will tell you if your attack
hits. If your attack hits, then you can roll 1d6 and add the same modifier
you used earlier.

### Free object interactions
Some actions such as storing or retrieving an object from your inventory, opening a door, speaking a six second message, or picking up an object
from the ground.

### Movement
Combat is centered around 5ft increments of distance. You may move in these increments. Once you have moved your maximum movement speed
in one turn, you cannot move again until the start of your next turn. Moving 5ft counts against all your movement speeds. This means
if you have 30ft movement and 15 flying, you may fly 15ft and walk 15ft, but you cannot walk 30ft and then fly 15ft.

## Checklist
If you do every step on this list, your character is done.
1. Roll ability scores. Swap one pair of scores if you want.
2. Choose class, adding starting gear and feats/spells/tricks.
3. Roll your hit points
4. Calculate your AC and carry weight
5. Name your character

# Exploration

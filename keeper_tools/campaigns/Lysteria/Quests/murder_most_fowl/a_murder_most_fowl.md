## Intro
Intro music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqTDOsGWLCY
The mayor of Flamevale has gathered the party to investigate a string of
murders. The murderer has left a feather behind at each crime scene.
The mayor explains that things are fragile right now, and he really needs a win
before the next election. If the party can solve this, the mayor will build
an adventurer's guild hall in flamevale. A gnome detective named Monty Mollis
will accompany them to the apartment, as he has the key.

## Crime scenes
- Alley on Baker Route
- Monty escorts to Apartment 8 at 352 Gray Passage
- The Metal Violin on Theater Avenue

### Apartment

The party finds the corps of a human man laying in bed in a room splattered with
blood. A feather is on his chest.
Details
- Victim was stabbed in the chest
- Footprints of multiple sizes
- One footprint has a symbol on it
- Victim has tattoo behind ear. It looks like a rune
- Bloody fingerprints on the doorknob
- A long, blonde hair on the floor
Monty will suggest the party brings these clues to the lab.

### Alley
The alleyway has a chalk outline of a body, but not much else. There's dried
blood and footsteps, but they are smudged. When the party tries to leave the
alley, three spectral thugs will show up, "What are a bunch of fleshies like you
doing around here, putting graffiti on Guul gang turf?"
One of them is drawing the word
"Goolz roolz" on the wall in chalk. If the party doesn't appease them, the
specters attack. Their leader carries a shortsword.

### Metal Violin
The party find the Metal Violin is a tavern with rooms on the second story.
Upon trying to enter, the party's told they need masks to get in, as the club
is an anonymous one. They're
offered some exotic masks for 5GP each.

The owner, Susan Morris, will scrutinize the group. There's a crystal chandelier
in the place, and someone is playing the violin for the audience, who are all
wearing fine clothes and wearing masks of various kinds.

The crime scene has been cleaned up completely of blood. There's a bed, a
nightstand, a window, and a desk. While looking, they see throws a green smoke
bomb into the room, then shut and lock the door. They hear footsteps moving away
rapidly. DC 12 con save to not be poisoned for 10 minutes. If they party chases,
they will find a man with a chicken mask and long blonde hair running(Sean Lawrence). The man
will throw caltrops. He will then get cornered in an alleyway for one turn,
drawing a poisoned dagger(2d6 extra poison damage).
"One nip from my blade and you'll never see the next day's dawn."
The party can fight him to the death, or if they hesitate, there will be a flash
of green behind his mask and he'll leap ten feet into the air, grab onto the,
wall, and leap onto the second-story roof of a building in the alley.

## Crime Lab
The party enters into the basement of a burned out office building where they
find a small team of undead ghost analysts. They can find the following
info on clues:
- The shoe symbol links to a high end cobbler on the Great Row
- The Rune is Abyssal, the library below Elegance(nightclub) might have more info
- The fingerprint matches a noble by the name of Terry Fenderson

## Cobbler
The cobbler is a high elf man named Svarsen who refuses to cooperate due to
fear of his clientelle. He has three customers with the specific shoe type. Two
are blond, but only one has long hair. The shorthair is Elizabeth Violet, and
the long hair is Terry Whisperwind.

## Elegance

### Ground floor
The building is lit with blue spectral flames, and there are ghosts playing and
dancing to loud music. The party can breakdance with one of the ghosts
(DC 12 acrobatics). There's a staircase down into a basement.

### Basement

#### Staff
In the basement, there's a group of spadetails serving people coffee for a
largely wild folk and corrupted soot audience.
- Rirvas (M): Will hit on fems
- Duvra (F): Will hit on anyone
- Sama (F): Will challenge to an arm-wrestling match

If the party asks to use the library, Sama will demand the party proves
themselves trustworthy.

#### Show
A wolf folk man named Beats gives some slam poetry while banging on bongo drums,
and then the audience will snap.

#### Dealer
A soot in a trenchcoat approaches the party and asks if they would like to buy
some moon dust for only 3gp. If they agree, they get a small glass vial
with one dose in it.

#### Library
There is a backgroom filled with bookshelves. A DC 14 investigation check finds
a book of demon runes. There's a spadetail sitting at a table in the room
asleep. If they wake up, they'll demand the party prove they have permission.
The book of demon runes has the exact rune used. It seems to be a soul-stealing
rune, drawn on sacrifices to offer their souls.

The mansion is guarded by two crown guards at the gate, and two patrolling the
spiked metal fence. If climbing, a DC 12 acrobatics or athletics check to avoid
taking 1 piercing damage. The bodies and bones in the shed are enough to solve
the mystery. A visible green light is shining from the lounge, where four
feather initiates, including Whisperwind, are performing a ritual. If they
interrupt it.

Alright, dweebs. Some priests from my hometown need caravan guards to help deliver some rather sensitive cargo to a volcano. Whatever you do, just don't screw this one up. It's our very first contract, and I had to eat a fist full of flavorless wafers just to get an audience with these weirdos.

## Caravan
The caravan moves in a straight line from the city to the volcano.

Pira is the priest in charge of the expedition. He explains
- An evil demon was spotted terrorizing the farmlands
- He is being kept at bay by magic
- At the mountain of spite, he will be sealed into a stone.

### Locations

#### City of Arcanus
Towering stone skyscrapers with crystal windows and 

#### The Gnarlwoods
A forest of baren trees with large green pods hanging. Opening any of the pods
causes a swarm of twig spiders to burst from the pod and attempt to eat the
party.

They find the old remains of an armored titan warrior on the side of the path,
tall trees sprouting from it.


#### The tar pits

#### The mountain of spite

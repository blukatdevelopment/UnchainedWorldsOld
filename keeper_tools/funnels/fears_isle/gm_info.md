## Introduction
This is a character creation funnel. Each player starts with a pool of
characters, and the combined party is exposed to a situation deadly enough to
whittle those numbers down. Players then each select one of their characters
as a PC going forward, leaving behind any remaining as backup characters. In
many ways, a character funnel acts as a tutorial for high lethality gameplay.
You may share this introduction with your players and allow them to follow along
with creating their commoners.

### Set expectations
Inform your players of the nature of this adventure, and what it may entail.
- Cooperation: Individual commoners are weak, but a team is strong.
- Challenge: The default option is often the most risky or costly.
- Creativity: You are more powerful than the abilities on your character sheet.
- Lethality: Death is a necessary part of making life-or-death choices.

### Commoner creation
Let's create some commoners! The process is streamlined, and the resulting
commoner is intended to have little to no feats. This is because each player
will create three commoners. Follow the process outlined below for each
commoner.

#### Roll stats
1. Ability Scores
Roll 4d6, then drop the lowest. You now have your Strength score. Continue
on for Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma in order.

2. Hit points
Hit points represent how much physical durability your body has.
Roll a 1d4 and add your Constitution modifier. You can use this chart below to
figure out your modifier, based on the score.
```
+-------+----------+
| Score | Modifier |
+-------+----------+
| 20    | +5       |
| 18-19 | +4       |
| 16-17 | +3       |
| 14-15 | +2       |
| 12-13 | +1       |
| 10-11 | 0        |
| 8-9   | -1       |
| 6-7   | -2       |
| 4-5   | -3       |
| 2-3   | -4       |
| 1     | -5       |
+-------+----------+
```
3. Determine Armor Class
Armor class determines how hard it is to hit and cause damage to your character.
You can calculate it as 10 + your Dexterity modifier.

4. Lineage
Lineage describes your biological and cultural makeup. For this funnel, lineage
will only change your appearance and have no mechanical effect. You may pick
from the following list.
- Soot:
- Uprooted:
- Wayfarer:
- Greenfoot:
- Burden Folk: A bulky animal-person 
- Wild Folk:

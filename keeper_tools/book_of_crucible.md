## Alignment
Crucible has a 9-point system of alignment. 

### True neutral (NN)
All creatures are born truly neutral. When they act, the aura of their soul changes to match. The acts of an average person tilt them neither to good nor evil. It is in continued acts towards good or evil that one's aura turns. As a counterpoint, one must consent to become lawful or chaotic, dedicating their life to it. This embodies true neutral alignment.

### Neutral Good and Evil (NG, NE)
Good seeks the perfect balance of maximizing joy and minimizing suffering for all, even when doing so does not benefit them. Evil, however, seeks to balance their own joy and suffering even when doing so robs the many of joy and brings them suffering. These are embodied in Neutral good and Neutral evil alignments. Examples of strong evil acts may be killing non-combatants, denying aid to those in need, or inflicting general suffering. Examples of strong good acts may be protecting the defenseless, giving aid to those in need, and generaly reducing of suffering or increasing joy. 

### Lawful and Chaotic (LG, LN, LE, CG, CN, CG)
Law establishes an order in the form of hierarchies via social institutions such as honor, law, and social norms. It believes a general shape of morality is valid, even if the particulars may stray. Chaos dismantles orderly social institutions in favor of discerning the shape of morality from each individual and in each individual moment according to the particulars. This encompasses lawful good, lawful evil, chaotic good, and chaotic evil alginments.

## Celestial Pantheon
Many lesser divines combined, forming more powerful divines containing multiple aspects. The celestial pantheon was formed by a few of these divines forming a loose alliance and creating a realm together from which they shape the world. They are perpetually in a state of cold war, their conflict limited entirely to the material plane where they compete using the prayers of their believers.

### Bimros
God of arrows, hunting, and dominion over nature. He created humans to rule the fields, dwarves for the mountains, and elves for the forests.

### Gegtix
Goddess of grass, trees, flowers, thorns, fruit, and rebirth. Creating the fae to protect her aspects as they are reflected in the Crucible's wildlife. Gegtix offers an oath to pursue this goal as well, granting druidic magic to those whoi take it.

### Kord
Goddess of sleep, ice, stone, and circles. Her avatar is a teal-skinned elf with white irises, and is known for leaving icy footsteps when she walks on land and water alike. Those who speak an oath to Kord gain magic that grows stronger in winter months.

### Yxheia
Goddess of knowledge, research, scrolls, and wisdom. Yxheia's oath is to preserve, spread, and pursue knowledge. Yxheia's temples always contain libraries that are open to the public, but are incredibly strict about the handling of books and scrolls, requiring flameless light sources such as sky lights and magic torches to be in use. Her scribes are often rewarded for their good deeds by gaining access to carefully guarded knowledge that is deemed to dangerous for the general public.

### Gidur
Creator of the waystones that mark the laylines across the world, Gidur is a divine of secrecy. Their aspects are unknown, and they deal exclusively in small cults. Gidur is happy to lose the game of being the dominant faith in the material plane. Rumors circulate of hundreds of different conspiracies they've worked towards, such as covertly hollowing a hills, constructing mazes, or growing a large crop of a specific mushroom, only to destroy it when it grows ready for harvest. Gidur's symbol is a special kind of glyph that becomes active upon completion. Anywhere his symbol is depicted, he gains a limited point of vision in the world. It's for this reason that it's considered taboo in most cultures to depict Gidur's name. Those who seek out Gidur's audience often use his symbol in graffiti, sometimes with nobles etching it under their courtroom tables, or artists including it subtly in ornate designs.

### Solus
God of fire, war, light, swords, and the sun, Solus is often represented by a symbol of the sun or a flaming sword. His avatar takes the form of a legendary flaming sword. Solus's oath of glory offers his followers magic on the battlefield through their sword, a popular choice for knights. The souls of fallen paladins of Solus are pulled into their blessed swords, turning them into sentient magical swords. Each temple of Solus requires at least one of such swords be on display. Followers of Solus occasionally speak of preventing the day of the flame, a hypthetical age when the world is so evil that Solus visits the material plane and turns the surface of the world to glass.

### Coent
Coent is one of the most powerful of the divines, comprised of dozens of aspects that are perfectly balanced in a slow dance. They embody neutral alignment. Their avatar slowly transitions, changing name from Coenta and Coento on a yearly basis, entering a pool of water in one form and emerging in the other. Various cults gather around a single aspect of Coent, waiting all year for that aspect to emerge and favor their individual goals.

#### Coenta
Coent becomes Coenta on the first of Coentas, assuming the form of a full-figured young woman with golden hair. In progression to the first of Coentos, her appearance shifts towards white hair, slender figure, and elderly features. Her younger form encourages romantic love, ignoring laws and norms, and the pursuit of individual joy. As she ages, she encourages a general familial love, shaping laws and norms, and the pursuit of universal joy.

#### Coento 
Coent becomes Coento on the first of Coentos, assuming the form of a bulky young man with fiery red hair. In progression to the first of Ceontas, his appearance shifts towards white hair, slender figure, and elderly features. His younger form encourages dutiful sacrifice, fighting evil law, and fighting individual suffering. As he ages, he encourages honorable service, reform of systems, and pursuit to universally end suffering.

## Fiendish Pantheon

## Lesser Pantheon
These divines are either single-aspect or not members of the Fiendish and Celestial pantheons for whatever reason.

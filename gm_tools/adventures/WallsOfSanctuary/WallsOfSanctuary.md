### The Royal Palace
Each member of the party receives a letter that reads as follows.
```
Noble adventurer,
It is with the king's honor that you have been summoned to partake in
festivities at the royal palace. Your reputation precedes you, and as such your
skills are desired by the king. Tidy yourself and arrive at the Eastern gates
at dusk. I eagerly await our meeting of minds.
Honor to the king,
Mardus, chief advisor to the king
```

#### Palm Reading
Aleris the palm reader will try to ask the party for a moment of their time
to lend their palms to her that she might read their fortune. If someone
volunteers, she reads their palm and looks shocked then asks them if they would like to
know what it says.
```
"In the near future you will kill the king."
```
Once she tells them, she'll ask for 10gp as payment.

If they pay, she'll give them a one-time blessing they can use in the next week.
If they deny her or attempt to haggle, she'll mark them with a curse instead.
The blessing or curse will appear on their body as a rune tattoo, and will fade
after it expires or is remedied.

#### Gates
At the Eastern gates two royal guards(Akil, Fenuku) wielding golden quarterstalves
fashioned like cobras will demand the party explains themselves before they
can proceed. They will tell the party they know, and that Mardus has tasked
them with stopping the party, and for the party to defeat them as their first
task.

```
Palace Guard
HP: 15(3d6+3)
AC: 12(leather)
Speed: 30ft
|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|
| 14| 10| 12| 10| 10| 10|
Double strike: After attacking a creature with the quarterstaff, the guard may
make a second quarterstaff attack against a different creature which deals 1d4
bludgeoning.
Attacks:
Golden Quarterstaff +5, 1d8+2 bludgeoning
```

#### Halls of the palace
The halls wind and fork, twisting back into themselves in a maze that one can
easily be lost in.

#### Royal introduction
Mardus will introduce each of the party members, telling of the story that
brought each of them here.

#### The briefing
By this point, Mardus explains that a relic known as the Wheel of Holar was
stolen en route to Sanctuary. The project to retrieve the relic was a well-kept
secret among the king's high-ranking officials, and so the king is forced
to seek external parties to help investigate. The goal is to determine
who took the relic, and tell Mardus where it is. The key suspects are the
engineer(Ianmorn), security(Odalric), and archaeologist(Aleksandra).
Mardus gives the apartment addresses for all three.

#### The guest chambers
The party is offered to eat, drink, and sleep in the palace in guest chambers.
This counts as a full rest. Roll a random event. 

+------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Roll |                                           Event                                            |
+------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|    1 | The king visits and explains what the Wheel of Holar does.                                 |
|    2 | Mardus has a drink and explains that the last party was lost outside Sanctuary to bandits. |
|    3 | The guards return with two friends(Tommi, Ohto) and want a rematch.                        |
|    4 | A jaguar wearing golden jewelry visits the party.                                          |
+------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jaguar

|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|
| 14| 14| 12| 10| 10| 10|
Pounce: If the creature moves 10ft in a straight line before attacking, the
target must succeed a DC 14 STR saving throw or be knocked prone.
Attacks:
Bite +4 1d8+2 piercing
Claws +4 2d4+2 slashing
```

### Interrogate the suspects

#### Ianmorn Boldspan
He'll offer this information:
- Odalric ordered the group to trade the relic for safety.

#### Odalric Mason
He'll offer this information:
- Aleksandra directed the caravan on a detour to study ruins conveniently before the attack.

If Pressed, he'll try to run, ensuing a chase scene. He'll:
- jump out the window and land on a cart full of hay below.
- run through the street and tip a cabbage stand to trip pursuers.
- then disappear into a tavern, where he'll try to blend into the crowd.
- start a bar fight, then escape into the alley, where he'll get cornered

If the party returns after questioning Odalric, he will be gone and Mardus
will report after one day that he's been sighted in an inn room near the Western
gate in the Silver district. If they find the room, they'll see his door is left
open and the interior smells of strong spirits. His bedroom window is open as well.
If they open the door without checking for traps, a glass bottle of spirits will 
crash and coat the adventurer. He'll then pop out and light them on fire. If they
go through the window, they'll find a hunter's trap on the other side. He'll try
to fight them.

If they investigate Odalric, he'll squeal and tell them the location of the 
Brass Knife Crew's hideout where the relic can be found. They paid him 100 GP to 
rig the security, and he used it to pay gambling debts that were due. The location
is the outskirts of a forestry town, Tensander.

#### Aleksandra Pekkanen
She'll offer this information:
- Odalric ordered the group to trade the relic for safety.

### Brass Knife Crew Hideout 
Mardus will offer the party transportation via the kingdom's private airship,
the Providence. The pilot, Topi Lehti, will take the party up and ask them
whether they want to touch down directly on top of the hideout, or get dropped
off out of sight so they can approach quietly.


#### The hideout map
The hideout is concealed in forest, but is clearly visible from above.

## New King
The relic was a piece of ancient outsider technology that can raise portals.
The king prepares a feast and his techs wire up the wheel above his throne.
When it fires up, it explodes and kills him.
The advisor asks the party to locate the king's estranged son and bring him
back before the king's next scheduled address in two weeks.

### Palace
The party is invited to the private viewing of the activation of the Wheel of 
Holar in one of his dining halls. Guards seal the doors and then the king gives
a speech to some nobles and let the party sit near the exit.

"The empire's state of decline is at last at an end. King Baruti brings you the
Wheel of Holar, an innovation of trade that will connect the disperate corners
of the world and bring an age of trade and prosperty rivaling that of the last
golden era. As the wheel of Holar turns, a portal to the Eastern coasts will
open and their traders will bring fresh fish and eel."

When it's switched on, there's a loud hum, and then it belches a 15 foot cone
of fire that knocks the king to 0 health. The smell of sulfure wafts from the
portal, and a bone thresher steps out. Roll initiative with the king rolling
death saving throws. At the end of every turn that the portal remains open,
a soul sucker will appear from the portal. Mardus will scream for the party to
shut off the wheel, claiming he will save the king. Four guards will help.
The map for this den looks like this, with tables marked with Xs.

At the end of the fight, the king is either dead, or in critical condition.
Due to old age, even healing magic has a hard time bringing back the king.
Mardus explains that this is terrible. With the king out of commission, the
people will soon fight to find a successor when they learn of it. He'll have the
nobles who witnessed the event held until a successor can be found. The only
heir to the throne is Baruti's son, Anttonen, who gave up his life of royalty
to live in the wilds outside sanctuary. The party must find and bring back
prince Anttonen before the king's next monthly address in two weeks, or else
the royals will split sanctuary into multiple factions in a civil war to
determine the next ruler.

### The providence
If the party repaired the providence, they'll get flown directly to Shehport.
En route, an ancient copper dragon with poor sight soars close to the providence
calling out compliments and pickup lines. He is visibly squinting. He has poor
hearing and will not hear anything as quiet as a normal yelling voice.
"Hey, baby, you fly here often?"
"That's a nice copper sheen you've got."
"Not much on talking? That's fine, I don't mind some quiet company."
"What's say you and I go land on that mountain over there?"
If the party does not stop this sequence, the dragon will then try and grab
the perceived female dragon's hand. In actuality, he grabs hold of one of the
balast chambers. Topi, the pilot, will call out.
"He's damaged one of the balast chambers! Quick, someone stop him! We're losing
altitude! Brace yourselves for a crash landing."
The providence will glide downward and the dragon will follow.
"What? Right here? In the open?"
The Providence lowers down until it scrapes on the road once, twice, and then
smashes into the ground. It's masts snap and it's sails fall to the side.
The dragon will jar the ship with his elbow, wagging his eyebrows.
"Hey, baby, now that it's just the two of us. Give me some sugar."
The dragon will lean in and start kissing the providence.

If attacked during this, the dragon will call out.
"Scram! Can't you see we're having a moment?" and flick the aggressor, giving
them 2d8 bludgeoning damage and sending them flying 30ft.

At this point, the Providence will be grounded while the dragon makes out with
it and the party will have to proceed on foot, having made one day of progress.


### The road to Shehport
The party is given a wagon with four horses. This trip takes four days on
horseback, or one via the Providence. Have one player roll a 1d6 for each day
to determine what happens. The wagon can provide partial rests, but not full
rests.

#### Day 1
```
+------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Roll |                              Event                               |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|    1 | A Jaguar covered in golden jewelry stows away                    |
|    2 | There are trees fallen on the path ahead. (Wilko Gang Ambush)    |
|    3 | A torrential downpour                                            |
|    4 | A traveling merchant offers to buy or sell potions               |
|    5 | One of the horses breaks a leg                                   |
|    6 | The party finds a herd of Long-necked dinosaurs grazing on trees |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
#### Day 2
```
+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Roll |                                 Event                                  |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|    1 | Red Talons Ambush                                                      |
|    2 | Fallen tree and Wilko Gang or torrential downpour                      |
|    3 | Family of badger folk heading to Shosa                                 |

|    5 | 1d6 crown guards order party to pay 10GP toll to continue              |
|    6 | There is an enormous nest of bees on a tree by the side of the road    |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
If it rains two consecutive days, the party's rations begin to rot.
Bees will cause 1d4 poison damage if disturbed, but the honey comb is worth 10GP.

#### Day 3
```
+------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Roll |                               Event                               |
+------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|    1 | Wilko Gang or Torrential Downpour                                 |
|    2 | Red Talons Ambush or Herd of three-horned dinosaurs grazing       |
|    3 | A swarm of pixies flies through a field and opens all the flowers |
|    4 | A lost girl                                                       |
|    5 | Thunderstorm (1d4, 1 = lightning strikes wagon or nearby tree)    |
|    6 | A lost dog with a collar that says "Hago of Shosa"                |
+------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
Hago is the name of the owner, not the dog, and he won't respond to it.
The human girl's name is Roti and was separated from her family when hobgoblins
attacked her parent's caravan. She doesn't know her parent's actual names,
but she knows that they were going to a place called Shosa.

#### Day 4
```
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Roll |                                    Event                                    |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|    1 | Wilko gang or horse gets sick from poisonous root                           |
|    2 | The cult of light or Red Talon Ambush                                       |
|    3 | Torrential Downpour                                                         |
|    4 | Sharp Tooth                                                                 |
|    5 | A traveler named Kari Kuri will offer to guide the party for 5GP            |
|    6 | A cloaked figure(Binzari) follows the party                                 |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
There are three cult of light followers in grey robes that shield their face with
hoods. Their leader Thora will ask "Do you have a moment to hear the good news?"
If allowed, he'll explain that most can not handle the truth, even despite it
being overwhelmingly positive. The light above's true form comes out at night,
and is a pale light kind enough to allow us to peer at it. The followers gave
up their names to join the cult of light. Their outfits are adorned with the
phases of the moon.

Binzari is taking alchemical ingredients for the lighthouse.
She wears hooded robe to cover her form, and will not speak immediately if spoken
to, but will still follow behind the party.

#### Sharp Tooth
The sharp tooth stands nearly twenty feet tall. It has tiny arms and an enormous
head with rows of dagger-like teeth. If the party has a caravan, it will approach,
snatch up a horse, break it's neck, then begin feeding on it on the side of the
road, allowing the party to go by.

```
Sharp Tooth
Huge Beast
HP: 90(10d12+20)
AC: 12(natural)
Speed: 40ft,
|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|
| 18| 12| 12|  4| 10|  4|
Multiattack: Sharp tooth can use bite and tail on two separate enemies.
Attacks:
Bite(10ft) +6 3d8+4 piercing
Tail(15ft) +6 2d4+2 bludgeoning
```

#### Wilko Gang
Patrik (2d6 of them) asserts that the road is, in fact, a toll road, and that
the party needs to pay them 100GP to pass. They'll settle for a horse, magic
item, or some other item. If disprespected, they'll try to beat up the party
member with greatclubs. If the party attacks Patrik, his bandits will stand
their ground and fight until first fatality. If they instead attack a bandit
with lethal force, Patrik will call for them to retreat.

```
Wilko Gang Captain Patrik
HP: 21(3d8+6)
AC: 13(hide)
Speed: 30ft
|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|
| 16| 12| 12| 10| 12| 16|
Multiattack: Captain can make two shortsword attacks
Attacks:
Shortsword +5 1d6+3 piercing
```

```
Wilko Gang Bandit
HP: 8(2d4+2)
AC: 12(leather)
Speed: 30ft
|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|
| 14| 12| 12| 10| 12| 12|
Attacks:
Greatclub +4 1d8+2 bludgeoning
```

If the party slays the Wilko gang and does not hide their bodies, a horseback
crown guard will approach the party and assume they killed the bandits and
demand that they come to the nearby town of Shosa to answer questions.

#### Red Talons Ambush
The Red Talon ambush will start with the pit trap. If the party has horses the
front one or two will fall in and break a leg. If the party is on foot, whoever
is in front must make a DC 14 DEX save or fall into the 10ft pit and take 1d6
bludgeoning damage. The Red Talon blades and Gogronur will appear from behind
a nearby tree and warn the party that their posessions are forfeit and they
will be unharmed if they comply. If the party submits to their search, the
blades strip them to their underwear and send them up the road without their
wagon or horses. They will fight to kill and only retreat if their captain
dies or orders it.

#### Guard Tower
If the party's brought here by a guard, they will need to answer questions to
the head of the guard, Ian. The guard will ask the following questions.
"Where do you hail from?"
"Where were you headed?"
"Did you see those bodies in the road?"
"Why didn't you stop to bury them?"

If the party's answers satisfies Ian, they can go on their way. Otherwise, 
they are sentenced to a day of community service while the bodies are
identified. The community service consists of scrubbing graffiti off the walls
of Little Sanctuary.

#### Temple of Light
The temple of light contains a shrine of lit candles and gives a service each
day at noon, when the sun is highest in the sky. When the party visits, the
resident reverend Konsta. If the party is pleasant when speaking to her, she
will offer a stay in the temple for free, granting a full rest.

#### The Pink Spade Tavern
This bar is owned by three spadetail sisters, Mith, Ces, and Binzari. A night's
stay and a meal is 5sp. The clientelle are almost exclusively beast folk.

Mith will bet 10GP that she can win at a game of darts. Make three dart attacks,
+6 for her. The highest total wins.

Ces will flirt with a random member of the party, and ask them if they're spoken
for.

Binzari will approach a random party member with a book. She confirms their,
identity and tells them that she's a big fan. She tells them an exaggerated 
version of their backstory, then asks if it's true. She will ask if the party,
per chance, is going to Shehport. If they are, she'll ask if they could deliver
a bag of glow dust to the lighthouse keeper, Shari. She'll ask for 5GP to cover
the cost, but inform that Shari agreed to pay 15GP for it.

A family of badger folk celebrate their youngest child's first birthday, and
will ask the party for suggestions for their name.

#### The Chunky Oak Inn
Owned and run by goblins adorned with jewelry, the male owner Fatguts will greet
the party with "Buy something or move along, this ain't a charity." unless they
seem to have money. He will offer to buy their wagon and horses for a combined
150GP and a free stay. He'll offer to buy any of their exotic pets for 50GP.
A night's stay is 5sp. If the party declines selling something, four
Fatguts goons will try to make off with it in the night.

A goblin lady named Hizra will greet and warn the party that they look a little
fancy to be staying here, and that they look like easy marks. They should make
a show of force DC 14 intimidation if they want people to leave them alone.
After they do that, she asks for 5sp for the advice.

A buff goblin named Gutpunch will get in an arm-wrestling match with another
goblin with smaller, more frail goblins, barely winning each time. He collects a
pile of 10GP in silver and copper on the table, then challenges the party to arm
wrestle him. He'll make a +2 athletics check. If he loses, he'll grow extremely
angry and demand double or nothing. When he does it this time, he'll be with a
+5 athletics. If his grift fails, he'll get up and try to fight the adventurer.
Fatguts will demand 10GP to dispose of the body discretely if Gutpunch dies,
or else will call the guard.

Attacks:
Bone Dagger: +4, 1d4+2 piercing
Stone Axe: +4, 1d6+2 slashing
```

#### Little Sanctuary
A section of the town is surrounded by walls, and guarded by crown guard. The
guard will scrutinize any of the party that seem out of the ordinary, and will
require 10GP for the group to enter. Inside are the following amenities:
- Blacksmith
- Stable
- Library
- Inn (1GP/night)
- Temple of Iron

### The town of Shehport
The sound of waves crashing and gulls screeching can be faintly heard from
outside the town.

#### Docks
On the surface of the docks, there are a variety of little shops.

##### Saltwater Tandra's Candy Store
Tandra pulls taffee. She sells candy:
- Hard candy
- Peppermint Sticks
- Dorhort Delight (ground nut confection)
- Saltwater Taffee
If asked about princes, she'll say that she knows someone that was friends with
a prince, Sandra. If the party buys a 1GP bag of candy, she'll tell them where 
Sandra is. She's either in Salforth's, or at home.

##### Salforth's Gourmet Seafood
Salforth(elf) is a chef who cooks very fancy food for 2GP per meal.
His signature lobster steak (made from huge lobsters) is the most popular.
If the party eats there, they'll meet a woman with pearls around her neck (Sanda)
who brags about knowing a prince. She knows that Anttonen changed his name
to Kari Kuri. He's living down in the underdocks.

##### Town Nautical Museum
A 1GP entry fee per person. Inside, there are a number of exhibits.
Rondonsir(Dwarf) will tell the story behind everything.
- Scimitar from the late Captain Hirab, who settled  Shehport
- Tank full of coral, anemones, and exotic fish
- Trained sealion that licks guests and arts
- Pirate flags and a harpoon gun (1d12 piercing)
- A collection of Rainbow Oyster pearls

#### Underdocks

##### Salty Sally's
A rough and tumble bar full of sailors and pirates alike. Sally will ask the
party what they'll have to drink. If they don't want grog or strong spirits,
she'll laugh at them, then call out "Get a load of these landlubbers!" and all
the bar will begin to laugh at the party.

If the party says pretty much anything to anyone, that person will challenge
them to a fist fight. If the fight escalates even slightly, it will turn into
a bar fight and everyone involved will be thrown out.

##### Real Sanctuary
A few shacks are set up with beds full of the poor and infirmed. A volunteer
nurse of the temple of light, Larla, boils a pot of roots and greens, and
crabs for anyone who is hungry. Kari Kuri's bed has a mural of Sanctuary drawn
on the wall in charcoal. There is a small shrine to the sun with candles.

#### Wet Market
The wet market has all manner of seafood sliced open on display for sale. There
are tanks of water filled with organisms swimming around that are sliced for
the customers. Some fish options:
- Sea Worms
- Blue sea slugs
- Rainbow Oysters - 1d20 chance it has a pearl worth 10GP
- Stripefish
- Blob trout
- Seal Eel

#### Lighthouse
If the party comes with Binzari, then the owner Shari(dwarf) will add a bag of
powder to the green flame of the lighthouse, keeping it going for another year
or so. She will offer some tea to the party. 

If the party has not encountered Binzari, then Shari will be dreading how
dim the lighthouse is getting. The Pink Spade inn in Shosa might have some
of the powder it needs, but she is too busy feeding the flame to go get it.

If the party has the glowdust, she'll gladly buy it for 15GP.

### The road back to Sanctuary
Once Anttonen has been convinced to return to sanctuary, or the party decides
to leave without him, they will need to get back onto the road. If they have
the Providence still, this is a quick zip. Otherwise, they deal with four
days of travel.

Each day, roll a 1d6

```
+------+------------+
| Roll | Event Type |
+------+------------+
|    1 | Combat     |
|    2 | Setback    |
|    3 | Setback    |
|    4 | Setback    |
|    5 | Neutral    |
|    6 | Positive   |
+------+------------+
```

#### Combat
Pick one of these that are relevant
- Wilko Gang
- Red Talon Ambush
- Gattogat
- Featherclaw ambush


#### Gattogat
A man in tattered clothes is running down the road. He warns the party that a
demon around these parts made him stab someone, and now he's on the run from the
law.

The next day, in lieu of an encounter, the party encounters the Gattogat. It is
four feet tall and acts like a housecat. It will pur, eat food, and receive 
pets. As soon as the party runs into a town, the Gatto will try to charm the
party, and if any member is charmed, it will use malevolent guidance to make
them attack a guard or random person.

#### Featherclaw Ambush

The party will hear a man crying out in pain for someone to help. when they get
closer, they'll see he's bloodied and pinned down by two featherclaws, who
look to the party. This is a trap. If the party approaches the featherclaws,
they will retreat and leave the wounded man alone. The trap will then spring.
The feather claws will focus on downing and dragging away one party member at a
time. The map looks like this:

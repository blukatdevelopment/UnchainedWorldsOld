### The Royal Palace
Each member of the party receives a letter that reads as follows.
```
Noble adventurer,
It is with the king's honor that you have been summoned to partake in
festivities at the royal palace. Your reputation precedes you, and as such your
skills are desired by the king. Tidy yourself and arrive at the Eastern gates
at dusk. I eagerly await our meeting of minds.
Honor to the king,
Mardus, chief advisor to the king
```

#### Palm Reading
Aleris the palm reader will try to ask the party for a moment of their time
to lend their palms to her that she might read their fortune. If someone
volunteers, she reads their palm and looks shocked then asks them if they would like to
know what it says.
```
"In the near future you will kill the king."
```
Once she tells them, she'll ask for 10gp as payment.

If they pay, she'll give them a one-time blessing they can use in the next week.
If they deny her or attempt to haggle, she'll mark them with a curse instead.
The blessing or curse will appear on their body as a rune tattoo, and will fade
after it expires or is remedied.

#### Gates
At the Eastern gates two guards(Akil, Fenuku) wielding golden quarterstalves
fashioned like cobras will demand the party explains themselves before they
can proceed. They will tell the party they know, and to beat it if the party
says that Mardus sent them. They will attack if pressed.

#### Halls of the palace
The halls wind and fork, twisting back into themselves in a maze that one can
easily be lost in.

#### Royal introduction
Mardus will introduce each of the party members, telling of the story that
brought each of them here.

#### The briefing
By this point, Mardus explains that a relic known as the Wheel of Holar was
stolen en route to Sanctuary. The project to retrieve the relic was a well-kept
secret among the king's high-ranking officials, and so the king is forced
to seek external parties to help investigate. The goal is to determine
who took the relic, and tell Mardus where it is. The key suspects are the
engineer(Ianmorn), security(Odalric), and archaeologist(Aleksandra).
Mardus gives the apartment addresses for all three.

### Interrogate the suspects

#### Ianmorn Boldspan
He'll offer this information:
- Odalric ordered the group to trade the relic for safety.

#### Odalric Mason
He'll offer this information:
- Aleksandra directed the caravan on a detour to study ruins conveniently before the attack.

If Pressed, he'll try to run, ensuing a chase scene. He'll:
- jump out the window and land on a cart full of hay below.
- run through the street and tip a cabbage stand to trip pursuers.
- then disappear into a tavern, where he'll try to blend into the crowd.
- start a bar fight, then escape into the alley, where he'll get cornered

If the party returns after questioning Odalric, he will be gone and Mardus
will report after one day that he's been sighted in an inn room near the Western
gate in the Silver district. If they find the room, they'll see his door is left
open and the interior smells of strong spirits. His bedroom window is open as well.
If they open the door without checking for traps, a glass bottle of spirits will 
crash and coat the adventurer. He'll then pop out and light them on fire. If they
go through the window, they'll find a hunter's trap on the other side. He'll try
to fight them.

If they investigate Odalric, he'll squeal and tell them the location of the 
Brass Knife Crew's hideout where the relic can be found. They paid him 100 GP to 
rig the security, and he used it to pay gambling debts that were due. The location
is the outskirts of a forestry town, Tensander.

#### Aleksandra Pekkanen
She'll offer this information:
- Odalric ordered the group to trade the relic for safety.

### Brass Knife Crew Hideout 
Mardus will offer the party transportation via the kingdom's private airship,
the Providence. The pilot, Topi Lehti, will take the party up and ask them
whether they want to touch down directly on top of the hideout, or get dropped
off out of sight so they can approach quietly.


#### The hideout map
The hideout is concealed in forest, but is clearly visible from above.

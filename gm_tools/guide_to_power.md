# Power (Player-facing rules)
Power is a resource, although ephemeral and abstract. The rules and guidelines
in this document provide a framework to explain the function of rules.

## Kinds of power

### Terror
When someone does something you said because they are afraid of the alternative,
they are responding to terror. Infamy founded by rumors is the next best thing
to actual malicious acts. Sometimes, however, just having the capability of
dealing great harm is enough to inspire conviction.

### Honor
When someone does something you told them because they feel it would be proper,
or otherwise improper not to, they act by honor. Honor may be as specific as 
doing what an elected or divine-ordained official tells you, or following a law 
because it's a law. It may also be much looser, such as volunteering for danger 
to avoid being labeled a coward.

### Contract
When someone does something you said because they feel it's in their own best
interest, or in the best interest of their community, they operate by contract.
Though contract may involve delivering material benefit to subjects, it does not
require it. A promise of hope for a better future can motivate. Likewise, one
need not be responsible for material benefit to take credit for it. So long as
you are viewed as particularly benevolent or serving the needs of the subject,
you can inspire conviction.

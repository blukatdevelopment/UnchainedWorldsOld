# Power (Player-facing rules)
Power is a resource. Though it's hard to accurately gauge the power cost
it's easy to see what sorts of things it can be spent on.
- Changing policies
- Pardoning crime
- Levying taxes
- Ordering executions
- Raising armies
- Sustaining armies
- Starting wars

## Types of Power
There are three ways to gain and keep power. The more you use them, the
harder it will become to stop.

### Might
You are mighty, and your people fear what you'll do if they do not cooperate.
To gain:
- Demonstrate your might
- Make examples of detractors
- Erect statues, place posters, hire propagandists

To lose:
- Ignore challenges to your authority
- Acknowledge failures

### Narrative
According to a popular belief, it only makes sense for you to lead.
To gain:
- Reinforce the narrative (Enlist experts, perform rituals, create norms)
- Spread the narrative (Enlist evangelists, perform charity, signal virtue)
- Punish Evil (take down criminals, reform deviants, villify dissent)

To lose:
- Allow others to shape the narrative
- Tolerate deviation from narrative
- Tolerate criticism of narrative

### Contract
Because you lead, bellies are full, rights are respected, and palms are greased.

To gain:
- Punish crime/corruption
- Hold a contest to reinforce legitimacy(election, trial)
- Give to the people (public services, gifts, popular reforms)
- Pacify your opponents(pardons, kickbacks, blackmail)
- Make promises

To lose:
- Bypass contests(skip election/trial, kill opponents)
- Ignore visible corruption
- Visibly abandon promises

## Gaining and losing power

### Power sheet
A power sheet is shared by the party and is used to represent the state of your
political power.
Your power sheet contains the following items:
- Total power
- Might Power Clock
- Narrative Power Clock
- Contract Power Clock
- List of political contacts
- List of politcal enemies

#### Power clocks
A power clock has a number of sections that are empty or full. When you tick a
clock, you fill a section. When your clock is full, add the number of ticks to
your total power and then grow the clock. A clock comes with 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12
sections. When you do something that detracts from your specific kind of power,
you empty sections on your clock. When you attempt to remove sections from an
empty clock, check whether it can shrink. If it can, subtract the number of
sections on that clock from your total power and then shrink the clock.


# Power (Game Master Rules)
So you want some sandbox political intrigue, eh? Well, look no further.
Note: I'm giving specific numbers and rules, and I expect you to tweak
break, or ignore them whenever it makes sense. You're the GM, after all!

## Set up your political landscape
This guide assumes you've made a world with at least one settlement,
different groups that live in it, and optionally some history or lore
to draw from.

What we want to do is make a bunch of NPCs that the players can interact
with, and for those interactions to be unique. If you're doing this
for the third time, roll a die instead of using the magic number three.

### The incumbents
Pick three people that rule, or one leader and their two close associates.
This could be three members of a parliament, coalition, or federation. 
Or maybe it's the king, the prince, and the queen. Maybe the sultan,
his daughter, and the sultan's advisor. No matter the power-differential,
their vested interest is in keeping the status quo, and either staying
in the seat of power, or maybe taking it.

### The Opposition
Pick three people that don't rule, but want to. One wants to take the
incumbent's place using the existing system. The second wants
to get there by throwing out the system, and the third also wants
to do that. All three hate each other's guts, but might cooperate
temporarily(and secretply plan to stab each other in the back). Note
that any of these three might be external to the system, such as the
leader of the neighboring kingdom, or a warlord looking to relocate.

### The Detractors
No matter who's in charge, there's people that don't like it.
Pick three people representing interests that don't rule and don't want
to, but really wish things were different than they are. This could be
a religious leader seeking an end to persecution, a mother who lost
her son to war, a peasant wanting to eat the wheat he harvests, a
xenophobe uncomfortable with their neighbors, a guild master that
wants more opportunities, or cat folk that just want to legalize catnip.

## Preface to mechanics
You're the game master. You adjucate the outcome of a player's actions. The dice
are here as tools, but they don't hold power over you. Even rules must defer
to your rulings. Your will is law. Your players have given this to you, and they
trust you to deliver the experience they're after.

### Purpose
Why are you doing this? What do you and your players want out of it? Are they
looking for **verisimulitude** to create a world that feels messy and real? Do
they **drama** to build and release tension in a satisfying way? Are you using
this system to fulfill some **power fantasy** the players have? You can balance
all three, but chances are any given player wants one more than the other.

### Complexity
There is an analogy that can be made between a video game and a GM. If a video
game features a great amount of complexity outside of where a player's character
can see or interact, it can slow down the whole game and impact a player's
experience. A video game solves this by not rendering objects that the player
can't see. The same can be used here. If you're going to run mechanics in
the background, have a very good reason for it, and see if you can minimize that
as much as possible.

## Power Lite
This is the minimalist take. It has four tiers, all reflecting how invested
your players are in the system, and thus how complex the mechanics get.
Power played this way acts like an adventure that concludes with the party
getting enough power to fix a problem they encounter. Your party wants power,
but they don't want it to be the main focus of the entire campaign, so they
can either install a new incumbent to take their place, or grow relationships
that they can leverage long after their power is gone.

### Tier 0: Bait
You want to give the party a taste of what power can do. If you really want them
to jump into power, show a good party injustice, or something that particularly
inconveniences or humiliates them. Other events can be neutral, or even helpful
to the party. 

Examples include a:
- King's army recruiters offer the party 1GP each to join up for a new war
- lady in a tavern reveals that she's the princess of this kingdom
- new law banning the use of magic
- public execution of political dissidents
- public dual between incumbents and opponents
- festival resulting from peace or victory with another kingdom
- secret meeting of opponents that the party walks in on
What else do you include? Nothing. Just two events like above to establish
the existence of power. If your players don't bite, introduce a couple more
until they do. If they don't bite, then they don't want power.

### Tier 1: First power
Your party wants power. Maybe they want to change a policy, pardon criminals,
broker peace, or overthrow the incumbents. Whatever they want, give them
their first opportunity to work towards that. Choose one opportunity, and tailor
it to your players. If they decline, determine the in-world consequences and then
Give them another offer.
Some examples:
- Detractors offer a side quest to help them resist incumbents. 
- Incumbent's minions interrogate party to make sure they're not opponents.
- Opponents seek out party to help them in their plot to weaken the incuments.
When the party completes their task, have a celebration for them. Maybe it's
a public celebration, or one that happens in private. Now you introduce players
to the mechanics.

#### The power sheet
The power sheet contains the following information:
- A count of power
- A progress clock with four ticks for each type of power (Might, Narrative, Contract)
- A list of any NPC contacts the party knows
- A list of any enemies the party has made

#### Award first power
Provide the player-facing rules to the party and make them a power sheet.
Have one of your players roll a 1d4. Now add it to their total power and any
of the clocks appropriate to what they just did.

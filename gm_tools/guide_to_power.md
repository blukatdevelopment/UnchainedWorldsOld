# Power (Player-facing rules)
Power is a resource. Though it's hard to accurately gauge the power cost
it's easy to see what sorts of things it can be spent on.
- Changing policies
- Pardoning crime
- Levying taxes
- Ordering executions
- Raising armies
- Sustaining armies
- Starting wars

## Types of Power
There are three ways to gain and keep power. The more you use them, the
harder it will become to stop.

### Might
You are mighty, and your people fear what you'll do if they do not cooperate.
To gain:
- Demonstrate your might
- Make examples of detractors
- Erect statues, place posters, hire propagandists

To lose:
- Ignore challenges to your authority
- Acknowledge failures

### Narrative
According to a popular belief, it only makes sense for you to lead.
To gain:
- Reinforce the narrative (Enlist experts, perform rituals, create norms)
- Spread the narrative (Enlist evangelists, perform charity, signal virtue)
- Punish Evil (take down criminals, reform deviants, villify dissent)

To lose:
- Allow others to shape the narrative
- Tolerate deviation from narrative
- Tolerate criticism of narrative

### Contract
Because you lead, bellies are full, rights are respected, and palms are greased.

To gain:
- Punish crime/corruption
- Hold a contest to reinforce legitimacy(election, trial)
- Give to the people (public services, gifts, popular reforms)
- Pacify your opponents(pardons, kickbacks, blackmail)
- Make promises

To lose:
- Bypass contests(skip election/trial, kill opponents)
- Ignore visible corruption
- Visibly abandon promises

## Gaining and losing power

### Power sheet
A power sheet is shared by the party and is used to represent the state of your
political power.
Your power sheet contains the following items:
- Total power
- Might Power Clock
- Narrative Power Clock
- Contract Power Clock
- List of political contacts
- List of politcal enemies

#### Power clocks
A power clock has a number of sections that are empty or full. When you tick a
clock, you fill a section. When your clock is full, add the number of ticks to
your total power and then grow the clock. A clock comes with 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12
sections. When you do something that detracts from your specific kind of power,
you empty sections on your clock. When you attempt to remove sections from an
empty clock, check whether it can shrink. If it can, subtract the number of
sections on that clock from your total power and then shrink the clock.


# Power (Game Master Rules)
So you want some sandbox political intrigue, eh? Well, look no further.
Note: I'm giving specific numbers and rules, and I expect you to tweak
break, or ignore them whenever it makes sense. You're the GM, after all!

## Set up your political landscape
This guide assumes you've made a world with at least one settlement,
different groups that live in it, and optionally some history or lore
to draw from.

What we want to do is make a bunch of NPCs that the players can interact
with, and for those interactions to be unique. If you're doing this
for the third time, roll a die instead of using the magic number three.

### The incumbents
Pick three people that rule, or one leader and their two close associates.
This could be three members of a parliament, coalition, or federation. 
Or maybe it's the king, the prince, and the queen. Maybe the sultan,
his daughter, and the sultan's advisor. No matter the power-differential,
their vested interest is in keeping the status quo, and either staying
in the seat of power, or maybe taking it.

### The Opposition
Pick three people that don't rule, but want to. One wants to take the
incumbent's place using the existing system. The second wants
to get there by throwing out the system, and the third also wants
to do that. All three hate each other's guts, but might cooperate
temporarily(and secretply plan to stab each other in the back). Note
that any of these three might be external to the system, such as the
leader of the neighboring kingdom, or a warlord looking to relocate.

### The Detractors
No matter who's in charge, there's people that don't like it.
Pick three people representing interests that don't rule and don't want
to, but really wish things were different than they are. This could be
a religious leader seeking an end to persecution, a mother who lost
her son to war, a peasant wanting to eat the wheat he harvests, a
xenophobe uncomfortable with their neighbors, a guild master that
wants more opportunities, or cat folk that just want to legalize catnip.

## Preface to mechanics
You're the game master. You adjucate the outcome of a player's actions. The dice
are here as tools, but they don't hold power over you. Even rules must defer
to your rulings. Your will is law. Your players have given this to you, and they
trust you to deliver the experience they're after.

### Purpose
Why are you doing this? What do you and your players want out of it? Are they
looking for **verisimulitude** to create a world that feels messy and real? Do
they **drama** to build and release tension in a satisfying way? Are you using
this system to fulfill some **power fantasy** the players have? You can balance
all three, but chances are any given player wants one more than the other.

### Complexity
There is an analogy that can be made between a video game and a GM. If a video
game features a great amount of complexity outside of where a player's character
can see or interact, it can slow down the whole game and impact a player's
experience. A video game solves this by not rendering objects that the player
can't see. The same can be used here. If you're going to run mechanics in
the background, have a very good reason for it, and see if you can minimize that
as much as possible.

### Conclusion
GM-facing rule sets can be constructed flexibly, depending on player interest.
This version of the guide to power contains the Power Lite rules, but more may
be added in the future. As a GM, feel free to develop your own.

## Power Lite
This is the minimalist take. It has four tiers, all reflecting how invested
your players are in the system, and thus how complex the mechanics get.
Power played this way acts like an adventure that concludes with the party
getting enough power to fix a problem they encounter. Your party wants power,
but they don't want it to be the main focus of the entire campaign, so they
can either install a new incumbent to take their place, or grow relationships
that they can leverage long after their power is gone.

### Tier 0: Bait
You want to give the party a taste of what power can do. If you really want them
to jump into power, show a good party injustice, or something that particularly
inconveniences or humiliates them. Other events can be neutral, or even helpful
to the party. 

Examples include a:
- King's army recruiters offer the party 1GP each to join up for a new war
- lady in a tavern reveals that she's the princess of this kingdom
- new law banning the use of magic
- public execution of political dissidents
- public dual between incumbents and opponents
- festival resulting from peace or victory with another kingdom
- secret meeting of opponents that the party walks in on
What else do you include? Nothing. Just two events like above to establish
the existence of power. If your players don't bite, introduce a couple more
until they do. If they don't bite, then they don't want power.

### Tier 1: First power
Your party wants power. Maybe they want to change a policy, pardon criminals,
broker peace, or overthrow the incumbents. Whatever they want, give them
their first opportunity to work towards that. Choose one opportunity, and tailor
it to your players. If they decline, determine the in-world consequences and then
Give them another offer.
Some examples:
- Detractors offer a side quest to help them resist incumbents. 
- Incumbent's minions interrogate party to make sure they're not opponents.
- Opponents seek out party to help them in their plot to weaken the incuments.
When the party completes their task, have a celebration for them. Maybe it's
a public celebration, or one that happens in private. Now you introduce players
to the mechanics.

#### The power sheet
The party's power sheet contains the following information:
- A count of power
- A progress clock with four ticks for each type of power (Might, Narrative, Contract)
- A list of any NPC contacts the party knows
- A list of any enemies the party has made

#### Award first power
Provide the player-facing rules to the party and make them a power sheet.
Have one of your players roll a 1d4. Now add it to their total power and any
of the clocks appropriate to what they just did.

### Tier 2: Patronage
By this point, the party has a list of contacts that will attempt to recruit them
to help them gain power. The patron may designate them as revolutionaries, 
king's elite guard, or some other title that aligns the party with that NPC.
They only become the patron when the party accepts. If the party never accepts,
then they return to Tier 1.

#### GM Power Sheet
It's time for you to make a power sheet of your own to represent the world's
political activity. This will consist of a number of power clocks repesenting
different interests in the political landscape you made. At tier 2, you will
want three clocks. One clock is the patron that your party is working for.
The clock size is 4, and it ticks each time the party completes one of their
side quests. When it is complete, they achieve some goal of gaining power.
Some examples:
- Win an election
- Gain control over major religious organization
- Discover the secret rebel base
- Capture the cult leader
- Prevent an invasion by opponent
At the same time, you'll want two more clocks. If possible, choose one entity
that your party knows about, and one that they don't. Define what advances
their clock, and then define what happens when the clock is full. These will
likely reverse the Patron's progress by a die the same size as their clock.
Every time the party does something to tick the clocks, tick it by 1d4.
Some clock examples:
- Attempted assassination of Patron
- Mercenaries or assassins hired to fight party
- Trap laid for party
- A major riot in the market square
- Insurrection
- An alliance between two enemies of the party
- A public speech is held decrying the patron.

#### Victory
Eventually, the patron's power clock will fill and the party will be awarded
4d4 power. Depending on their personality, the patron will either ask the party
to be their successors, relegate them to a position of very little power, or
attempt to have them killed now that they've outlived their usefulness.

The party may dismiss this opportunity, or may seize it and take the place of
their patron through might, narrative, or contract.

### Tier 3: Full Autonomy
The party has outgrown their position as the lap dogs of a patron, and they
now hold the reigns to their own fate. Time to take the training wheels off.

From this point on, you can introduce the Advanced Power rules, or end the
campaign with your party being rulers, depending on their preference.

#### Party's Power Sheet
The sheet the players use now has an additional field called Upkeep. Each item
has a die. Every in-game month, the party rolls all their upkeep dice and
subtracts that amount from their power. Here's a common sheet for upkeeps:
```
+----------------------------+--------+
|           Asset            | Upkeep |
+----------------------------+--------+
| Each unit out of territory | 1d2    |
| Spy                        | 1d2    |
| 4 man scouting Party       | 1d2    |
| 16 man army                | 1d4    |
| 64 man army                | 1d8    |
| Fortress/Castle            | 1d10   |
| Airship                    | 1d10   |
+----------------------------+--------+
```

## Advanced Power
These are advanced rules. This is effectively a second game run on top of the
main Unchained Worlds campaign. Ensure your players know what they're signing
up for. If you have not already run the Power Lite rules, try running them first.
This is your only warning.

### Political Landscape
Refer to the "Set up your political landscape" section in the Power Lite rules
to populate a cast of about 9 NPCs that have interests.

### World Map
Make a 50x50 grid. Now add the following to the map:
- Mountains, Desert, rivers, coastline(if relevant)
- Terrain type for each cell of the grid (Forest, Field, Rocky, Desert, Water)
- Capital occupying 4-6 tiles, name them as districts
- Three Cities, occupying 2-3 tiles each.
- Three Towns, occupying 1-2 tiles each.
- Three Villages, occupying 1 tiles each
- Roads between cities, bridges across rivers, shipping lanes on shore

### Party Power Sheet
A sheet with the following information should be all the party needs to track
their power:
- Total Power
- Power clock for each type of power(Might, Narrative, Contract)
- List of enemies
- List of contacts
- List of Power Upkeep
- List of power assets
Here's an example of a power sheet for a party that has a lot of power:
```
Total Power: 12
Might: 3/6
Narrative: 0/4
Contract: 0/4
Contacts:
- Lord of Deer(Druids)
- Arch Priest(Temple of Light)
Enemies:
- Riguzzah(Demon army)
Power Assets:
- 1d4 Reindeer Farm
- 1d2 Tin Mine
Power Upkeep:
- 3d4 Armies(16 man)
- 1d8 Armies(64 man)
- 1d10 Castle
```

### GM Power Sheet
Look over the political landscape. Create up to 9 progress clocks.
An example:
```
Successful Demon Abduction -> 0/6 -> Demon Portal Opens
Druid Speaking Event -> 0/4 -> Druid-aligned Protests at reindeer farm
Day without defensive spy -> 0/4 -> Sabotage Tin Mine
Day without defensive army -> 2/6 -> Rebel insurrection
Show of force -> 0/4 -> Peasant riot
Day of Foreign Spy operations -> 0/6 -> Foreign Invasion Starts
```

### Power Assets
Power assets are anything that contribute power to the party's Total Power.
Power gained by a specific category ticks the appropriate power clock, so
tyrants can maintain some contract by offering free ale, or zealots can grow
their might with an execution block
Some general examples:
- Mines
- Special Resources (Silk, Horses, Dinosaurs, Living Trees)
- Trade Routes
Some Might examples:
- 1d4 Execution block
- 1d2 Public stocks
- 1d4 Monument
- 1d4 Secret Police (Occupies a Spy)
- 1d8 Security Checkpoints (Occupies an Army)
Some Narrative examples:
- 1d8 Public Daily Rituals
- 1d4 Shrines
- 1d4 Narrative-biased Education
- 1d8 Narrative-biased media(criers, news paper, evangelists)
- 1d4 Narrative-biased laws
Some Contract examples:
- 1d8 public gladiator pit(Requires Structure)
- 1d4 theater(Requires Structure)
- 1d4 free grain
- 1d4 free ale
- 1d8 public forum(Requires Structure)

### Power Upkeep
Maintenace of armies, spies, and structures consumes power. Other forms
of assets can be included with this. Here's an example list.
```
+--------------------------+--------+
|          Asset           | Upkeep |
+--------------------------+--------+
| Each unit away from home | 1d2    |
| Spy                      | 1d2    |
| 4 man scouting Party     | 1d2    |
| 16 man army              | 1d4    |
| 64 man army              | 1d8    |
| Public Structure         | 1d4    |
| Fortress/Castle          | 1d10   |
| Airship                  | 1d10   |
+--------------------------+--------+
```

### Spending power

#### Enacting Policies
If you have an army, structure, or resource you'd like to start exploiting,
decide the effort from one of the options(1d4, 1d6, 1d8). That's the cost
to make it happen.

#### Recruiting Units
Recruitment cost is rolled at the time of purchase.
```
+------+---------------------------+
| Cost |           Unit            |
+------+---------------------------+
| 3d4  | Spy                       |
| 1d6  | Hunting party(scout)      |
| 1d6  | Town Patrol               |
| 2d12 | Crown Skirmishers brigade |
| 5d20 | Crown Pikeman Army        |
+------+---------------------------+
```

#### Erecting Structures
In addition to a power cost, there is a construction cost.
```
+------------+--------+------------------+
| Power Cost | Months |    Structure     |
+------------+--------+------------------+
| 2d10       |      3 | Public Structure |
| 4d20       |      6 | Castle           |
+------------+--------+------------------+
```

### Combat
Combat on the world map that doesn't involve the party follows different rules
from unchained worlds. If the party is involved, please refer to the stat 
blocks found in the book of monsters.

#### Movement
Units move 2 squares per day on the map, or 4 on a road. A scout moves
twice this speed.

#### Hiding
A scout or spy may hide by rolling 1d20 and getting 12 or above. A hidden enemy cannot be attacked.
A spy may seek out a hidden enemy unit by rolling 1d20 and getting 16 or above.
The stats for different units:
```
+-------------+--------+--------+----+------------+
|    Unit     | Attack | Damage | AC | Hit Points |
+-------------+--------+--------+----+------------+
| Spy         | +1     | 1      | 10 |          1 |
| Scout       | +2     | 1d4    | 12 |          4 |
| 16 man army | +4     | 1d8+2  | 14 |         16 |
| 64 man army | +8     | 2d8+4  | 14 |         64 |
+-------------+--------+--------+----+------------+
```

#### Attacking
When one unit borders an enemy, they may attack. When they do so, roll
a 1d3. On a 1, the attacker goes first.
To make an attack, roll a 1d20 and add the attack bonus. If it meets or
beats the enemy unit's AC, then then roll and subtract damage. After both
attacker and defender go, each army can decide to stand their ground
or retreat into a neighboring square. A unit can retreat once per day.

#### Castles and other fortifications
If a defending unit is inside a castle or fortified structure, they
receive a +4 to their AC

#### Restoring units
Every day spent at a friendly castle restores a unit by 1d4 hit points.

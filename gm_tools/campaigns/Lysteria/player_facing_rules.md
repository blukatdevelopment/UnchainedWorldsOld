## Character creation rules

### Steps to create a commoner
1. Get a token/actor in Foundry
2. Roll abilities(4d6, drop lowest), swap up to one pair
3. Roll for background
4. Pick lineage
5. Apply commoner proficiencies/equipment

### Stats
For ability scores, roll 4d6 and drop the lowest. Abilities are rolled in order,
but one pair of abilities may be swapped before any bonuses are applied. Health
is rolled. If your character changes from commoner to another class, health is
re-rolled.

### Character Slots
Each player has three character slots. They may retire any character level 1 or
higher. If the player has an empty character slot, they can fill it with a new
commoner.

### Character advancement
Each player character starts as a level 0 commoner. (See: Core rules commoner
class) When you level up, you may pick a class. You keep all your skill
proficiencies, but reroll your hit points using the new class's hit die.

#### Table rule: Session-based XP
For this campaign, XP an every session will grant 1XP.
```
+-------+----+
| Level | XP |
+-------+----+
|     0 |  0 |
|     1 |  1 |
|     2 |  2 |
|     3 |  3 |
|     4 |  5 |
|     5 |  7 |
|     6 |  9 |
|     7 | 12 |
|     8 | 15 |
|     9 | 18 |
|    10 | 21 |
+-------+----+
```

## Sessions

### Board
The game master will put 1-2 items on a quest board.
These may be dungeons, jobs, or other activities that the guild members may be
interested in. Players may also add any plot hooks to this board to investigate
later.

### Plan
When game masters post a session listing, players may sign up. If no sessions are
available for a player, or the player wants to do something specific in the
world, then that player can request a session from the pool of game masters to
see if anyone can help them with that.

### Play
The party makes any purchases and hires any hirelings. They then embark on their
adventure, traveling to the location. They leave and return to a guild hall.

## Hirelings
Adventurers may take hirelings with them and may give orders to their
hirelings using their bonus action. Hirelings may refuse orders or defect
depending on their morale and the nature of the orders. The GM can voice the
hirelings if they so choose, or may leave them silent.

### Torchbearers
These hirelings will come along, carrying loot and torches for you as well as
filling non-combat roles. They will likely hide or flee from combats.
They charge 2SP/day to come along.

### Mercenaries
These hirelings are equipped with swords and prepared to fight alongside
adventurers in combat. They charge 2GP/day to come along.

## Downtime Activities

### Work
You work and pay your living expenses exactly. Hooray.

### Help
You pay 10GP to keep your bills paid and provide for travel expenses, then help
someone accomplish their downtime. That someone may make one roll with advantage
, and may benefit from spells or abilities you are capable of offering.

### Learn survival from Kati
You pay 10GP to spend some time with Kati, who knows a thing or two about
surving in the wilderness. You make a DC 12 investigation check. If you
succeed twice cumulatively, you will become proficient in survival.

### Learn Goblin from Ash
You pay 10GP to learn Goblin from Ash. You make a DC 12 investigation check.
If you succeed twice cumulatively, you learn the goblin language.

### Buy a magic item
Using 10GP to cover the bills and travel expenses, you follow some leads that
the magic shop owner offers you on finding magic items.

#### Finding the selection
Make a persuasion check, which represents you talking your way to the better
selection of magic items. The roll determines which table you'll be using. You 
may not receive any assistance with this task unless someone in the session's 
party uses their downtime to help you. You may pick a lower table if you choose.
Once you've selected your table, roll 1d4 times to see what items you find.

```
+-------+-------+
| Roll  | Table |
+-------+-------+
| 1-17  | A     |
| 18-24 | B     |
| 25-30 | C     |
+-------+-------+
```

#### Price
Roll the price for each item accordingly.
- Consumable items are half the rolled price.
- Add the cost of normal armor to that of magical armor.
- Spell scrolls are rolled after purchase, unless you cast the identify spell.

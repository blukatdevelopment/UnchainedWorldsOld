## Character creation rules

### Stats
For ability scores, roll 4d6 and drop the lowest. Abilities are rolled in order,
but one pair of abilities may be swapped before any bonuses are applied. Health
is rolled. If your character changes from commoner to another class, health is
re-rolled.

### Commoners to adventurers
Each player starts with three level 0 characters with the commoner class from
the core rules. Their lineage can be selected from the imperial lineages,
but their background is rolled randomly from the list in 100 backgrounds.

When a player's commoners level up, they may select one of them to level up into
a leveled class. They become level 1 in a class of their choice from the list
below. Any other surviving commoners can be held in reserve, taking the place
of the player's character if they are retired or killed.
- Alchemist
- Gunner
- Lycanthrope
- Priest
- Psion
- Runesmith
- Soul Forger
- Thief
- Tinkerer
- Warrior

If all of your characters are dead or retired, you gain three more commoners.

## Sessions

### Board
The game master will put 1-2 items on a quest board.
These may be dungeons, jobs, or other activities that the guild members may be
interested in. Players may also add any plot hooks to this board to investigate
later.

### Plan
Players pick something they want to do that session. Based on this description,
the game master prepares any content needed for the session. The players and
game master then schedule a session.

### Play
The party makes any purchases and hires any hirelings. They then embark on their
adventure, traveling to the location. They leave and return to a guild hall.

## Guild Headquarters Upgrades
Characters can invest their gold into various upgrades to the adventurer's guild
headquarters in order to give all characters perks.

When adventurers retire, many become mentors in the academy, shaping commoners
into proper adventurers. The benefit of the academy is based on the level of
the most experienced mentor. When commoners become adventurers, this structure
effects what level that adventurer starts with when they ascend from commoner.

```

### New Guild Hall
Adventurers may build a new guild hall in a city they've visited. Doing so
allows them to start from that new hall, and potentially be closer to future
quests or dungeons. The more guild halls, the more high profile quests will
be offered.

```

## Hirelings and services

### Burial (10GP)
Characters that die with at least 10GP can be buried with a 32 letter
inscription on their tombstone. One of their surviving peers comes up with this
inscription.

### Cleanup Crew (2GP/Day)
This crew loads a donkey cart with loot. On major roads, it travels two squares
a day and takes 1 day to load up.

### Construction/Excavation Crew (4GP/Day)
This crew consists of a large team of builders or miners that can burrow through
walls and locked doors, as well as install ladders and elevators in vertical
shafts.

### Coach(1GP/day)
High speed carriage that moves four squares per day across roads. Each night
camping with the coach counts as a full rest.

### Torchbearer(15GP deposit, 15% Commission)
A torchbearer is a commoner that will follow one adventurer closely into
dangerous situations. They may carry a light source, haul loot, or offer some
sort of special ability. They will refuse hazardous orders like scouting ahead
or opening a suspicious chest with their bare hands. The hireling office is
paid 15GP upfront, which is returned in full upon the torchbearer's safe return.

If a torchbearer is bloodied or sees an ally die, they will make a DC 15 wisdom
save to act heroically. If they fail, they will make a DC 15 intelligence save
to act in their best interest. If they fail both, they panic and retreat.

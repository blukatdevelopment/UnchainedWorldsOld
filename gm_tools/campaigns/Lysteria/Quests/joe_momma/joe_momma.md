## Posting
The posting reads:
"Sama from Flamevale says she's found something important after digging through
all the library books checked out by 'Joe Momma'."

### Road to/from Flamevale
Each player rolls a 1d20. If one of them rolls under a 5, then they are ambushed by
human bandits wearing black headbands and demanding they deposit half of
any gold they have to ensure safe travels. The captain's name is Leroy, and the
group is known as the Black Sashes.

Leroy will start with "Hey, gnome girl. What's your name?" They'll hold up a
picture, then look at Akatsuki. "One of my buddies spotted you selling
a hammer with my brother's name on it right as he and his crew went missing.
Something tells me you know where he's at. Well? Spill the beans."

The entire group has 2d12GP, 2d20SP, and 2d100CP on them.
Bandits:
- 1 Bandit Captain
- 2 Bandits
- 2 Petty Bandits

If they roll under 10, then they are visited by a group of three Guul Gang
thugs. They will recognize any of the party from "A murder most fowl" and will
demand the party pay the "Guul tax" of one gold per head in order to overlook
the mayor's lapdogs trotting around on their turf.

## Elegance

### Ground floor
The building is thumping with magically produced music. There are ghosts of
all sorts dancing, and one T-posing in the air with lightning occasionally
flying from his hands.  There's a staircase down.

### Basement

#### Staff
The spadetail staff will be working. 
Rirvas(M), Boch(M), and Duvra(F) are currently on staff, and Sama(F) is in the
library. 

When the party visits Sama, they'll find she has bags under her eyes and
there are empty coffee mugs piled up on the table with some books. There's a
corkboard with pins in it connecting various pieces of paper with strings.

Sama tells the party that this his third night awake, and she thinks she's
narrowed it down to three locations, but there's no time to explain. She will
immediately pass out at that point, snoring loudly face-down at her table.

If she's brought back to consciousness, she'll answer questions in a rather
disorderly fashion, giving the party an explanation like below. She'll then
recommend they go interrogate Sean.

On the board:
- Flamevale: Location of Terry's Cult Cell
- Terry Whisperwind: Sean's boss, dead
- Sean Lawrence: Captured cult member, spilled beans
- Crasia: Terry's boss, female
- Joe Momma: Name books were checked out under
- Book of Dragons
- Book of Demons 
- Book of Cults
- Bonespell: Possible Cult location
- Blackdrift: Possible Cult location

### Crime Lab
When the party reaches the crime lab, they find Monty Mollis having coffee and
sweet rolls. He offers to share some with the party, then mentions that he won't
share any with Lucky, because he's heard nasty rumors about him. When they go to
visit
Sean, they find him laying face down on his bed in his room. If they
investigate, they'll find blood on the bed. Rolling him over reveals it's the
body of a Frankle, the man trusted to watch over Sean. Frankle's neck has been
slit, and there's a fresh tattoo on his ear. Mollis will comment that this
means Sean probably walked right out of hear in Frankle's outfit, and could be
anywhere right now.

### Road to/from Shadowtown
Each player rolls a 1d20. If one of them gets a 1, then they are ambushed by
soot-covered Uprooted dwarven bandits. The leader, Svaroren will tell the
party that the humans bought out their mines and expelled they and their 
families from it. In order to make the next couple weeks, they'll need 15GP
from the party, or the equivalent in goods. If the party is unwilling, then
Svaroren
- 1 Bandit Captain
- 4 Bandits
- 4 Petty Bandits

```

### Shadowtown
This town's buildings are only partially populated. The doors and windows of
buildings are barricaded and boarded up.

#### Day
During the day, the market square is the entirety of the town. It has a few
functions at once. There's clearly no more than a thousand living here. The
people look gaunt and dirty.
- Market where looted goods are bought and sold.
- Restaraunt tent that serves rice and beans, will feed the party for free
- Medical tent that will heal the party for free
- King Magnus's throne tent
- Children being taught archery
- A performer will play "Shadow of Mardur"

##### Shadow of Mardur
"King Magnus rules justly until the sundown.
That witching hour when the sun is burried in the ground.
The shadow of mardur is cast on this town.
Those caught on the streets are never again found."

#### Night
The party will be offered a room to rest in during the night. Their stay will
be inside an out of service airship parked on top of a maintenance rig.
The undead horde will come stumbling through the city, looking for people. If
the party does nothing, they'll see the undead begin bashing through a
barricaded building, swarming it, and then pulling away a family who begin
calling out for help. Saving the family nets the party 100XP.

The horde consists of 10 zombies and 5 zombie runners.

##### Mardus's chambers
Mardus can be found practicing a speech in a mirror.
"It's simple. You must die to be reborn again. I'm doing this for
your own good. Chin up. Don't you want to live forever?"
Two reapers are standing in opposite corners of his room.

If a PC is killed, they will be stabbed with Death's Bane and brought back as
undead. There's a small box of jewelry in his room. It contains
- 1d6+1 * 25GP topaz amulet
- 1d4 * 25GP ruby ring

### Road to/from Bonespell
Each player rolls a 1d20. If one of them gets lower than 5, then they are 
ambushed by a band of wolf folk hunters, demanding the party turn around and 
head home. Their leader is Whitefang. If the party convinces Whitefang they
are no threat, he will lead them to Bonespell and introduce the party.
If killed, they will drop 2d4 silver and 2d6 copper as the following:
- 1d4 5GP carved drinking horns
- 1d4 3GP necklaces with human teeth
Bandits:
- 1 Whitefang

```

### Bonespell
If accompanied by Whitefang, the party will be introduced into the town and
welcomed to stay in one of their homes for the night.

Whitefang will explain that this used to be a sugar plantation, but that his
people overthrew their masters and have since been converting the place into
a town. They say a human had come this way looking for some of the masters
that used to live here, but left for Blackdrift when he was told they were
all executed for their crimes.

If the party comes without Whitefang, roll a 1d4
```

|    3 | hunter demands they wait while he gets Whitefang |
|    4 | a monster carries off a child to it's cave       |
+------+--------------------------------------------------+
```

If the town's populace is alarmed, the same group from the random encounter
above will visit them.


#### SilverBraid's contest
SilverBraid, the strongest hunter, will offer to wrestle
any member of the party, wagering his +1 dragon fang spear for something of
equal value to him (likely a metal weapon). He has a +3 to athletics. If he
loses, he'll look embarassed and challenge the PC to a sparring match. He
has the same stat block as a Wolf Folk Hunter above. In such a fight, he'll
use his fists (+4, 3 bludgeoning) and try to grapple the PC to get an advantage
on them. The wrestling is 25XP, and sparring is 25XP. If the PC beats him twice,
a wolf folk woman named LeafWind will approach and flirt with them if they
are masculine, wanting to become their companion. Otherwise a male named
TrueHeart will approach them seeking their companionship.

#### Monster Hunt
In the morning, the party will be offered a meal and a contract. Whitefang
will offer 15GP for the party to hunt down and kill a monster that's been
endangering the village's children. If the party accepts, Whitefang will give
the party instructions to reach the monster's cave. If the party succeeds,
they will earn 100XP.

##### Monster Cave
On the way, each player rolls 1d20. A nat 1 has the parry ambushed by the
monster. Otherwise, they find it waiting in it's cave during day, and away
hunting at night.

##### Ships in the night
LeafWind and TrueHeart will both come on to the party if they succeed in
defeating the monster. 

```
Eyeless Beaker
Huge Monstrosity
A featherless, eyeless bird with a 15 foot wingspan and talons. It uses echo
location and keen hearing to "see" it's way around. It's wings use skin flaps
to keep it aloft.
HP: 27 (3d12+6)
AC: 12
Speed: 25ft, 60ft fly
|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|
| 16| 14| 14|  4| 10|  4|

Multi-attack: May make talon and beak attack
Toothed Beak +4 1d12 piercing, grapple on hit

### Road to/from Blackdrift
Each player rolls 1d20. 
If any player rolls a 20, the party encounters a lone goblin scout hiding in
a bush. Her name is Snarg, and she'll give away information about Blackdrift
and the ambush ahead if they let her live.


If they roll lower than 5, then a random character falls
into a pit trap and must succeed a DC 12 DEX save to grab on the edge, or else
receive 1d6 piercing damage as they are impaled on the sharpened sticks at the
bottom. If they succeed, they cling onto the edge. At this point, the ambush
is sprung. The blackdrift tribe descends on the party, trying to catch them
live. If they succeed, they bring the party back to begin eating them one at
a time.
- 2d4 Blackdrift Ambushers
- 2d4 Blackdrift Hunters

```

```

### Blackdrift
The town was abandoned by it's humans, and so was repopulated with goblins that
formed the blackdrift tribe. Zarrzarr, the boss, will invite the party to stay
the night and join them for a feast at the Heavenly Frog. If the party reveals
that they've fought and killed the goblin ambush, the goblins will look scared
and Zarrzarr will be fetched.

#### The militant approach
If the party at any point begins attacking, then a militia consisting of
three waves of 2d4+1 hunters will come and rush the party,  After a few deaths,
the hunters will surrender.

#### The Heavenly Frog
If they agree to this, the goblins will challenge them to all sorts of contests.
Some goblins will hit on Polket, thinking he's the only one of the party that
looks attractive.
- Arm wrestling DC 12 Athletics, wager 1SP, 25 XP on win
- Danceoff DC 12 Performance, wager 1SP, 25 XP on success
- Catch the greased rat, DC 16 Athletics, wager 1SP, 25XP on success
- knife-throwing contest, AC 12, 14, 16 targets. Wager 1SP, 25XP on success
- Racing chicken eels (Three animal handling checks, +2 for gobbo)
- 4-player Game of Bandit's Bluff. 1GP entry, up to 3GP wager 1sp, 25XP

#### Bandit's bluff
Each player puts in an entry wager, then plays in up to three rounds.
Each round, the player is dealt a card. They can either hold, fold, or raise.
If a player raises the wager, a player may call their bluff, which ends the game
with the total each player has on that round without drawing any more cards.
There are three rounds where players are dealt a D12, D10, and D8

#### Celebration Drink
If the party plays some of these games, the goblins will offer celebration
drink. Each that imbibes the drink must succeed a DC 17 CON save, or else
fall unconscious. On a success, they are instead poisoned for one hour. An
unconscious PC will be held to knife point, and leveraged as a hostage in order
to take the others into custody.

#### Prison
The town's prison is repurposed to hold food. The party will be stripped of
their posessions and left in prison cells with Sean Lawrence. He will point
to a chest where the party's posessions are hidden. If the party won any of
the contests, a goblin will show up and try to break the party out in exchange
for a favor.

#### Sean Lawrence
Sean, absolutely at his whit's end, will give the party the following
information.
- He was trying to meet up with Crasia, because his boss was dead
- The cell in Bonespell was wiped out
- The cell in Blackdrift had apparently abandoned the city for the nearby mountain
- His role was collecting souls for the cult, but he didn't know why

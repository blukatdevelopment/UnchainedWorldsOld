### On the road

#### Black Pauldrons 
A band of six human bandits demand the party give them 50GP, or something fancy.


## Sandfrost
The party will be approached by a chikileaf(chkmn002). If attacked, it will cry out, and a small child will run up to defend it. Her name's Chelsea, and she'll direct the party to talk to the mayor.

### Mayor's house
The mayor's house has a secretary that doesn't want the party to talk to the mayor because she might get in trouble for interrupting his daily time in the peace garden.

If they convince her to talk to him, he'll be feeding his chikicarp(chkmn004). If the party's interested in becoming chikimon breeders, he'll offer to sell them a pair of chikiroar(chkmn005) eggs for 400 chikimon cards(company's currency). He won't accept gold, and won't acknowledge it as worthwhile. If the party's short on cards, he tells him he'll give the eggs for free if they bring back Chikimon Trainer Billy.

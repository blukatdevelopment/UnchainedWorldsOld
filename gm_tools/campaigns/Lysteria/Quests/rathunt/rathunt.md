## Blackdrift

The goblins are having a kart racing contest, gambling 25GP for winner.

The king will say that there's more cultists on the mountain with big rats.



## Ratville

At the base of the mountain, there's now a stick fence and several more A-frame houses. There's a sled team of giant rats pulling lumber from the nearby woods, and there's giant rats pulling wooden plows for fields. 

The rat king now wears black robes and carries a staff.
He will explain that he and his rats have helped build the thorp into a village, and that the cultists living here are thriving under his rule. He'll offer to fight the party alone, but only if they can assure him the village and his rats will be safe without him.

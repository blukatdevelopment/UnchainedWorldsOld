### Appraisal
An appraisal check is an Intelligence check. The DC is determined by the rarity of the valuable as follows:

```
Rarity    Appraisal DC
Common    5
Uncommon    10
Rare    15
Very Rare    20
Legendary    25
```
If the valuable has historical, religious, or arcane significance, allow proficient characters to add their proficiency bonus as appropriate.

If the character has proficiency with a tool that would be used to work or create the valuable, grant them advantage on the roll.

On a success, describe the item as appropriate and provide an appraised value as explained below.

## 1 Coat room (30GP)
A specter will tell the party that they can leave their coats here, but ask that
they not touch anyone else's coats. They then disappear. There's a rack with
a few outfits of fine clothes on it. There's a skeleton on the ground with it's
arms holding it's throat. Touching any of the coats will cause 5 to fly out and
surround the character that touched it. There are 2 outfits remaining, 15GP
each.

```

## 2 Buzzsaw (30GP)
There is a 30GP emerald sitting on a pedestal at the end of this room. The floor
is metal and there are slits in it. A skeleton lays on the ground with their
femurs cut in half. If a player steps on the floor, a buzzsaw rises up, slicing
them and dealing 1d10 slashing damage.

## 3 Soaking room (30GP)
This room has a staircase leading downward, but appears to be a bathroom.
There's an enormous bathtub steaming in with fresh bath water, an elegant
folding screen(5GP), a shelf with fluffy white towels(5GP), and a shelf of
soaps, shampoos, fragrances, and beauty products(20GP). Entering the room will
enrage the tub, which turns out to be animated.

small square of gold attached to them. Touching the tile with bare hands will
deal 1d10 lightning damage. Touching with a shoe will set the shoes on fire,
dealing 1 fire damage unless the character can succeed a DC 12 dex save to put
them out. Each piece of gold, if removed, is worth 5GP.

X: Doors
```
## 1 Library (30GP)
There is a staircase up to the first floor, but there's also several bookshelves
arranged in the room. If the party tries to take any off the shelf, they'll find
many of the books rise up into the air to form two swarms of animated books.
After the fight, there are 13 books of various sizes still on the shelf that
add up to 30GP.

```

Multi-attack: May make 2 paper cuts

```

## 2 Hallway(15GP)
At the end of the hallway is an enormous piece from a dragonchess set. It is the
bishop. From the perspective of Room 1's door, there are two doors 60 feet
ahead, and two more doors 60 more feet. The bishop will say
"Halt!"
"You may go."
A creature who moves their normal speed must succeed a DC 13 DEX save or move
after being commanded. The DC is 16 for creatures that dash. Each time someone
moves after a halt command, one random person who has moved is targeted by the
zap. The bishop opens a small compartment, revealing a 15GP golden bishop piece.
It will lower down each 6 second slice, being hidden after 5 slices.

```
Bishop
This device is made to enforce rules within a dungeon, and will only attack
when those rules are broken, or in self defense if tampered with.
Large Construct
HP: 55(5d20)

Zap: One creature must succeed a DEX saving throw to halve 3d6 lightning damage.
```

## 3 Pickle Room (50GP)
There are shelves of jars containing pickled vegetables. A hairless, eyeless
creatures pickled inside enormous glass cases. A closer inspection reveals runes
carved on the glass. Many are various stages of transition from pumpkin into
other creatures. Three of the most beastly look to be wolves, but one is a bear,
and has five 10GP sapphires floating in the brine. There's also an impression
of a jar that's no longer there.

```

gains advantage on the attack.
Bite +4 1d8+2
Claws +4 2d4+2 slashing
```

## 4 Puppet show (50GP)
Entering this room reveals a stage with marionettes performing a little skit
before an audience of manequins. If the party looks up, they'll see a black
blob on the ceiling with dozens of hands orchestrating this charade. The blob
has an enormous humanoid mouth. Each marionette is about two feet tall. The
lighting is dark, with candles behind the stage.

### Puppet show
Donkey: Heehaw, we've made it at the top of the mountain, and lo, the princess
is is captur-ed by yonder frost giant. 
Hero: Never worry, trusty steed, for I am Finklefarce, the brave!
Princess: Do not ye come another step!
Hero: Worry not, princess! You will soon be free from this ugly creature.
Frost Giant: You forget yourself, naive! The queen hath come of her own volition.
Donkey: Her own volition?
Princess: Verily, he speaketh the truth. We will soon be betrothed.
Hero: Then let me instead present an honor for the queen to be.

The hero puppet holds up a large ruby that gleams in the room's candlelight.

```
Puppetmaster
A blob of inky black flesh that pulses and sprouts hands. This outsider comes to
hold puppet shows and lure creatures into it's mouth for a snack.
Huge Aberration

## 5 Mage's Quarters (30GP)
The mage's spectral form awaits the party. He will introduce himself, asking if
the party has enjoyed his dungeon thus far, and informing them that in mere
moments he will finish his meditation and ascend to a higher spiritual form. He
holds up a spectral gem and offers them a trade. If they wait for him to finish
the transformation, he'll use his newfound power to materialize the gem and they
can go about on their business.

The party will find the storm mage in here, meditating. There is a bear-like, 
wolf-like, man-line creature in a large glass capsule like from the pickle room.
It has a 50GP gem in each eye(purple Amethyst, green reddish albite).

If the party allowed the mage to ascend, he will say "Oh, I thought I had more
time....." and then transfer his mind to the creature.

# Second Wave
The party destroyed the bath tub, burned the library, broke the bishop, stole the
ruby from the puppetmaster, trashed the pickle room, and then irritated the 
projection of the storm mage.

## The mage's reinforcements

Since the party has ravaged the mage's lair, he has contracted a small band of
commoners to help him. 

Three petty bandits wait in the hallway of the first floor with a jar containing
a pickle wolf. They tell the adventurers to scram, or they'll bust the jar.

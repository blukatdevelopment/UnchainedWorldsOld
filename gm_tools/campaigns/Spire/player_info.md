## Setting
A mountain rises from the endless sea, and at it's zenith rests a spire from a
long-forgotten age. Within it's walls, gates flicker with an arcane glow,
linking the location to other realms. The adventuerers that congregate in the
spire are problem-solvers and opportunists looking to explore the unknown, to
aid those in trouble, and to find wealth and notoriety.

## Intro
This campaign features multiple keepers who run sessions and adventures.

## Making characters
To play, you'll need a character. Characters generally start at level 1, but
you can talk to a keeper if that's undesired. The process outlined in this doc
is the standard one. Keepers may offer additional options.

### Ability Scores
You can pick one of the two arrays of numbers below. Assign the numbers from
your chosen array to your ability scores in any order you'd like.

Standard array: [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]
Min-max array: [17, 14, 13, 10, 9, 7]

### Culture
You can either freely choose, or roll 1d10 to determine the culture your
character was brought up in.
[Cultures](../../../character_creation/cultures_volume_1.md)

### Body Type
You can either freely choose, or roll 3d4 to determine your character's body
type. Note that the bodytype governs the mechanics of your character, but not
your appearance. A character with a common body may look like a human,
anthropomorphic animal, goblin, or many other options.
[Body Types](../../../character_creation/3d4_body_types.md)

### Class
You may choose a class for your character, which represents the unique abilities
they gain as they gain levels over their adventuring career.
- [Alchemist](../../../character_creation/classes/alchemist.md)
- [Gunsmith](../../../character_creation/classes/gunsmith.md)
- [Lycanthrope](../../../character_creation/classes/lycanthrope.md)
- [Priest](../../../character_creation/classes/priest.md)
- [Psion](../../../character_creation/classes/psion.md)
- [Runesmith](../../../character_creation/classes/runesmith.md)
- [Thief](../../../character_creation/classes/thief.md)
- [Scientist](../../../character_creation/classes/scientist.md)
- [Warrior](../../../character_creation/classes/warrior.md)

### Starting gear
Your new character additionally starts with 80G to spend. Please consult the
core rules for a comprehensive list of general adventuring gear they may
purchase.
[Core Rules](../../../core_rules.md)

### Mechanical tweaks
If you have tweaks you'd like, talk them through with your keeper. If you want,
we can have an example.

```
A completely hypothetical player creates a catfolk character with a common
bodytype. His character has claws, and he wants this to be reflected. He asks
the keeper if it's ok if his unarmed attacks deal slashing damage instead of
bludgeoning. The request is so simple and minor that they immediately say yes.
Thinking it over, he decided to ask for an alternative. Maybe his character's
unarmed attacks could deal 1d4 slashing damage? The keeper thinks about it,
shrugs, then allows it. He thinks, then says "ok, but what if they could also
see in the dark for 60 feet, and they could also climb up trees, and they could
also resist cold damage due to their fur, and gained extra proficiencies because
cats are stealthy, and also-" and the keeper stops him. "Woah, that's a lot. 
Let's just keep this simple." So the player thinks, picks a couple items from
their wish list to have. The keeper gives the thumbs up, and now their character
has bespoke features.
```

## Lethality countermeasures
Any character that dies can be resurrected by spending 100GP on a ritual to do
so. If you find yourself feeling uncomfortable with the level of lethality,
please reach out to keepers, who may help offer mechanisms to make you feel
comfortable.

## Playing in sessions
When keepers prepare content for a session, they may post it in the `#sessions`
channel, where they will put all discussion of the session into a thread.

When there are no games, you may begin discussion of new sessions in the
`#session-brainstorming` channel, where you can create a thread for your request
so that a party can be formed and scheduling/planning can be done. When a
session is created, it will be posted in the `#sessions` channel. Alternatively,
a keeper may agree to run an adventure for a given group of players, and create
a thread for it in the `#adventures` channel.

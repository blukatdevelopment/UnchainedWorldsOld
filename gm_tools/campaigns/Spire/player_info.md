## Setting
A mountain rises from the endless sea, and at it's zenith rests a spire from a
long-forgotten age. Within it's walls, gates flicker with an arcane glow,
linking the location to other realms. The adventuerers that congregate in the
spire are problem-solvers and opportunists looking to explore the unknown, to
aid those in trouble, and to find wealth and notoriety.

## Intro
This campaign features multiple keepers who run sessions and adventures.

## Making characters
To play, you'll need a character. Characters generally start at level 1, but
you can talk to a keeper if that's undesired. The process outlined in this doc
is the standard one. Keepers may offer additional options.

### Ability Scores
You can pick one of the two arrays of numbers below. Assign the numbers from
your chosen array to your ability scores in any order you'd like.

Standard array: [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]
Min-max array: [17, 14, 13, 10, 9, 7]

### Culture
You can either freely choose, or roll 1d10 to determine the culture your
character was brought up in.
[Cultures](../../../character_creation/cultures_volume_1.md)

### Body Type
You can either freely choose, or roll 3d4 to determine your character's body
type. Note that the bodytype governs the mechanics of your character, but not
your appearance. A character with a common body may look like a human,
anthropomorphic, goblin, or many other options.
[Body Types](../../../character_creation/3d4_body_types.md)

### Class
You may choose a class for your character, which represents the unique abilities
they gain as they gain levels over their adventuring career.

- [Gunsmith](../../../character_creation/classes/gunsmith.md)
- [Lycanthrope](../../../character_creation/classes/lycanthrope.md)
- [Priest](../../../character_creation/classes/priest.md)
- [Psion](../../../character_creation/classes/psion.md)

- [Thief](../../../character_creation/classes/thief.md)
- [Scientist](../../../character_creation/classes/scientist.md)
- [Warrior](../../../character_creation/classes/warrior.md)

### Starting gear
Your new character additionally starts with 80G to spend. Please consult the
core rules for a comprehensive list of general adventuring gear they may
purchase.
[Core Rules](../../../core_rules.md)

## Playing in sessions
When keepers prepare content for a session, they may post it in the `#sessions`
channel, where they will put all discussion of the session into a thread.

When there are no games, you may begin discussion of new sessions in the
`#session-brainstorming` channel, where you can create a thread for your request
so that a party can be formed and scheduling/planning can be done. When a
session is created, it will be posted in the `#sessions` channel. Alternatively,
a keeper may agree to run an adventure for a given group of players, and create
a thread for it in the `#adventures` channel.

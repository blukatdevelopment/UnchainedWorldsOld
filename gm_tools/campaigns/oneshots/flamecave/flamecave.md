## The road there
The party meets in the guildhall in Torrid to hear about their newest contract:
a job to find and slay a monster that has burned down a nearby farm settlement,
Eldorine. They're patron, Chauncy, explains that the Duke's offering 100gp to
any group that can bring back the monster's head.

```
The party finds itself seated around a circular table in a one-room building.
Hanging from the support beams are banners identifying the space as the home of
town of Torrid's adventurer's guild. A nervous donkey man in fine clothes
scatches at his chin and examines the party.
```
He'll demand each member of the party identify themself and explain why they
think they're fit for a job as dangerous as the one he has.



```
Stepping out of the guild hall, the party is inundated with the sounds of
Torrid. Merchants call out to chattering, meandering crowds in the street. A
guard on horseback clip-clops across the stretch of cobblestone road before the
town's Inn(Red Stripe Inn), tavern(Rusty Flagon), and a small string of shops.
Just then the bonging of bell in the temple of Eir marks the noon hour, and the
closing of the farmer's market. The guard approaches the party.
"You must be the new group they're sending to Eldorine."
"'Fraid none of 'em came back."
```

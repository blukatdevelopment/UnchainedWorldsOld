#### Cures
When someone diagnoses their malignant lycanthropy, roll on the following table
for a cure for this particular case.


## Diseases
When a character is created with a negative constitution modifier, it is often
because they have a disease. If not cured, the diseases will degrade their
health and they may die as a result. Once cured, a the previously diseased
adventurer's constition is raised to 10.

### Bogrot
Often caught from handling unclean frogs or swimming in raw sewage, bogrot
appears as black necrotic boils that burst to leave craters in the flesh.
The infected is vulnerable to necrotic damage. After having bogrot once, you
are immune from catching it again. If a healthy character catches bogrot, their
maximum hit points drops by 1d4 until they are cured.

### Ink Lung
Often caught from exposure to land squid ink and or magically-enriched coal,
ink lung causes the infected to cough small clouds of black ink dust.
If the infected uses the dash action, they must succeed a DC 15 con save or
enter a coughing fit, which consumes their reaction.

### Chicken Kisser's Lament
The only documented account of kisser's lament was a man who kissed a chicken
eel on the beak. However, he was torn in half when found, so a direct cure
is not known. Symptoms include growing a ring of white feathers around one's
lips. When the infected hear a loud noise, they must succeed a DC 16 wisdom
saving throw or use their reaction to move their entire movement in the opposite
direction of the noise.

### Angry Boils
It's difficult to say how many have been infected with anger boils, as
a diagnosis requires making patients angry. The infected will grow large red
boils on their face when frustrated or angry. After one hour, the boils recede
and the infected no longer shows symptoms as long as they remain calm. When the
boils surface, the character must succeed a DC 12 CON save or take 1d4 necrotic
damage. If the boils are cleansed with a flask of holy water or a DC 17 medicine
check using an herbalism kit, they are cured.

### Elf's Itch
The infected's ears grow inflamed and red, and itch intensely. When not treated
with a calming salve, the infected has disadvantage on ability checks. The salve
must be applied every four hours. Every night, the infected may make a DC 16 CON
save for their immune system to fight off the infection. Elves make this check
with disadvantage.

### Sneeze Itis
The infected experience a runny nose, nasal congestion, and frequent bouts
of sneezing. When exposed to strong smells, animal dander, pollen, or dust,
the infected must succeed a DC 15 con save or enter a sneezing fit for 6
seconds.

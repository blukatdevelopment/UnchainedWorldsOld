# Preface

Oh, hey there! It's me, Blukat, your friendly neighborhood gamemaster. I just
wanted to give a quick heads-up. My intent in writing a guide isn't to speak
authoritatively and create a relationship with this game where players and GMs
search for my social media activity to determine rulings. No, my goal is to
provide tools and perspectives that could be useful to GMs picking up this
system. My advice and tools will be limited by my experience, and my later self
will possibly find it necessary to rewrite this book from the ground up.

The Unchained Worlds system is intended to be compatible with community content
creation, and as such, content creation advice will be included along with
general GM tools. If this is your first time GMing, I'll try to provide
sufficient definitions. So strap yourself in and enjoy the ride!

## What is a gamemaster?
A tabletop roleplaying game like Unchained Worlds generally involves players
gathering around a physical or virtual table, and then playing the roles of
characters in a fictional world. It is collaborative storytelling exercise.
Players will generally play cooperatively with one another to accomplish goals
and face off against challenging enemies, environments, and traps in the world.
Dice and the derived mechanics are used to introduce a random element. This adds
a random element that lets players gamble with their actions, and react to
complications introduced by failures as well as successes. The players write
their own player characters. So then, who makes the non-player characters, the
enemies, environments, and traps of the world? That's you, the gamemaster.
Players give the gamemaster control to judge the outcome of their attempted
actions through rulings. They can use the rules as a tool, but can ignore or
replace any rules at any time. In exchange for giving this control up to the
gamemaster, players can expect to make a fun game that tells a memorable story.

# A GM's toolkit

## Campaign Format
Ok, so you want to prepare a world and tell a story. Let's figure out the format
you'll go for with this. Each has different requirements for attendence,
commitment, and the GM's prep.

### Oneshot
A oneshot is a low-investment option to engage new players. Players can make
a character for the oneshot, or pick from a list of pregenerated characters. The
key to a oneshot is scope. A oneshot lasts for one session. Additionally, the
low-investment for players can make lethality easier to process. The small scope
also is easier on new gamemasters to do a little prep and then get into it. If
you have a player interested in GMing, maybe recommend they start with a
oneshot?

### Episodic
Like television broken into episodes, each session is essentially a oneshot.
You might loosely connect the episodes together based on a plot thread that
concludes with a season finale. This format is great when your party is not
consistent, and allows for players to join in and drop out without losing
much continuity nor having to read up on a long-lived backstory of previous
sessions. Episodic play is great for switching GMs frequently.

### Saga
This one's more like a book or movie series. Each session blends seamlessly
into the next to tell a larger story. There's often an overarching plot with
a main antagonist, forcing the players into the role of heroes. These generally
involve the most up-front planning, which is often farmed out to a third party
resulting in premade adventures. The author of a premade adventure spends 100
hours preparing content so that you can spend a dozen hours reading it over and
adapting it to your world and party.

### Sandbox
A sandbox takes players, drops them into a world with cool stuff, and says 
"Ok, what do you want to do?" You're not "supposed" to go anywhere, or do
anything. That's to say, the gamemaster dangles opportunities in front of
players and lets them decide what they'll pursue. Content might be completely
premade from the beginning, or there might be tools that help to randomly
generate events, dungeons, and content. The melding of premade and randomized
content gives GMs considerable freedom to use prepared content as a jumping-off
point for improvised content. A GM might only know there's a tavern with two
NPCs bickering in it. From that, they can fill in the blanks as they go, and
use the player's interactions as further inspiration.

## Campaign premises
Sweet, you've found a format to play under. Now, what's the premise of the story
you'll be telling with your players, and what kind of challenges will the
party face? Many of these can be scaled down into oneshots, or scaled up into
entire adventures. At the same time, cobbling multiple together can make for
some variety.

### Five room dungeon
A dungeon with five rooms. Works for a oneshot, a chunk of a full campaign.
These are an excellent way to structure simple oneshots, and make great first
sessions for a new GM. Combine a couple with an over-arching plot and you can
make an adventure.

#### Room 1: Entrance and guardian
Why are your adventurers the first to enter this dungeon? Is the entrance hidden
behind a waterfall, or do you need a special item to unlock a magical door?
Maybe the party needs to reach the summit of a mountain on the night of a blue
moon. Whatever the reason, decide what, if anything, this challenges the party
to do. It may simple be a bit of spectacle, or a brief introduction to the
dungeon's lore, the signs that say "turn back", or scattered remains of those
who came here before. If your dungeon is deadly, now's a good time to leave
clues to your players that they've left safety behind.

#### Room 2: Puzzle or roleplaying challenge
In the depths of the dungeon, give your players something to think about. An
interesting NPC to interact with is one option. Maybe there's a talking statue
that has information you need. Maybe there's a door that only opens once you
arrange the pieces of a tangram. Whatever challenge you give the party, make
sure there's a way for them to continue if they fail. If you intend for puzzles
to be lethal if failed, you'll want to talk to your players and make sure they
consent to this first.

#### Room 3: Trick or setback
Ok, so they found an entrance, solved the puzzle, and now they're going to
clobber some monsters and call it a night? Not yet! Put a trap in the way! Or,
maybe have an NPC turn on them now that they no longer need the party to get
into the dungeon.

#### Room 4: Climax, Big Battle, or Conflict
Your entire dungeon has built to these next moments. Your party takes the gem
off the pedestal and the place begins to collapse. They enter the chamber where
they will finally slay the shadow beast. They finally reach the door of destiny
with the five gems of power, and stand in anticipation as the stone doors slide
open. Whether you fight, evade damage, or show some spectacle, it doesn't
matter. The party leaves this room when they've beaten the dungeon.

#### Room 5: Reward, Revelation, Plot Twist
with the monster slain, you pick through the remains of the adventurers that
failed before you. You bust open the doors to the dragon's hidden vaults. You
discover the prophet's son is actually alive. You find a map leading to the
caves of ruin and splendor, home of the blade of the stricken. Whatever it is,
it crisply ends this dungeon and readies the party for what comes after, whether
it be spending their newfound loot, or entering the next chapter of their
overarching plot.

#### Redefine "dungeon" and "room"
Do you need your players to go underground to enter a dungeon? Nope. Do you even
need a dungeon? Negative. Instead of a dungeon, have a city with five specific
locations as rooms. Have a journey through a forest with different rooms being
legs of the journey. Get wild, shuffle the order of the rooms, and test out
whatever experiments you think would be cool. This isn't a cookie cutter, it's
a bunch of building blocks that can assume any number of shapes together.

### Hex Crawl
Regardless of whether you use a hex grid or a square one, you have predefined
or procedurally generated content on a world map, and the party seeks out riches
and power in their adventures through it. Hex crawls are played more as a game
than as a story, and as such benefit greatly from lethality and challenges that
demand thinking outside the box instead of simply using combat or abilities.
Think of it like arcade mode where you're challenged to get the next high score,
and expect to die many times to achieve it.

### West Marches
Every session, the party starts in their safe headquarters and sets out into
danger. There is a world, and it is up to the players to tell the GM where they
want to go and what they want to do. This differs from a hex crawl in that the
content is created via collaboration, and is driven by the players. Each session
ends at the headquarters, and so player commitment can be for a single session
at a time. A large pool of players can share a GM this way. This is also a
decent way to run megadungeons, dungeons that take many sessions to explore
fully in an arcade-esque fashion. If there is a plot behind west-marches, it is
chiefly written by the players.

### Monster of the week
Your players start in their homeland, and the trouble comes to them. Maybe
they are bounty hunters bagging bounties each session. Maybe there's
literally a new monster showing up each session. Maybe there's simply a new
job each week for a patron such as an adventurer's guild. If made highly lethal,
this is a good recipe for horror survival. If made with little lethality, this
is a good casual mode of play for players with inconsistent schedules. You can
also have an overarching plot, but it generally has very little player autonomy
due to the episodic nature of the campaign. When you resolve one plot, you
run a session as a season finale, which may be longer or more intense than
normal.

### Mystery
The play starts with the reveal of a mystery, and it ends with that mystery
being solved. This can be a oneshot like an episode of a detective show, or it
can be a layered mystery like the long-term plots strung across 

#### Epic Adventure
You have a big story to tell, so there's a big plot that spans many serialized
sessions. There's high continuity, and your characters will each get a chance
for a character arc and side stories tying in their backstory. Each chapter acts
like a season of a monster of the week campaign, but has more momentum. Each
player must be present in each session, or you'll run into continuity issues. A
chapter resolves a lesser antangonist or conflict, which is part of a larger
conflict. You might want a big, bad, evil person (BBEP) who is playing chess
with the adventurers, or you might have some antagonistic force such as
an ice age or coming age of chaos that forces the party to work decisively
to avert disaster. Whatever the case, you give plenty of space for players to
roleplay and flesh out their characters. It's advisable to make one chapter at
a time, with the bones of the entire plot laid out from the start, and define
how you want leveling to be paced(one or two levels per chapter).

## Prep tools

### Medium

#### Pen and paper
The original medium for tabletop games, and by far the most flexible. You
don't need any computer know-how to make use of them.

Physical paper is extremely versatile. You can draw a table, write a body of
text, and draw an illustration on the same page to your desired level of detail
without one iota of software. If character sheets don't have what you need,
you can make your own that looks just right. The main difficulty you'll
encounter with paper is organizing it. So, don't be afraid to organize your
paper in a binder, and to give each player their own binder with pockets full of
information that's used often as well as any campaign-specific information they
might frequently refer to. Maybe a world map? Definitely a couple pages of
blank paper for them to take notes with.

#### Text
Text is the duct tape of information systems. No matter how pretty you can get
other formats of data (like save files for an application), text can fix
anything. It's versatile enough that you can do any facet of your DM prep using
only plain text files. It's also sturdy. Text editors rarely encounter the
kinds of technical issues more complicated systems do. Even when you use
automation for [Text art](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/), [Images](https://www.ascii-art-generator.org/),
[Tables](https://ozh.github.io/ascii-tables/), and [Graphs](https://asciiflow.com/#/),
you can make the same content by hand with enough patience. This means that if
such a tool should break or become unavailable, you can fix everything with
duct tape.

Can you make a character sheet this way? You betcha. Can you make stat blocks
for monsters? Most definitely. You can map out dungeons, store images as
ASCII art, and more! A text file has about as much freedom to it as a sheet of
paper.

### Copious notes
Is this something I do? Not well. Is it something everyone should do? Hell yeah!
When your party picks up treasure, jot it down. When they anger someone, jot
it down. After a combat encounter? Jot down who they just killed, and why. When
the session ends, jot down a two sentence summary of where you left off. This
comes in handy when you're trying to recall what's inside your player's 
inventory(especially cursed items) four sessions later, starting the next
session, or creating new material and trying to tie in the player's actions.
Oh, and that obscure NPC you came up with six sessions ago in a forest village?
Your players remember his name, and you should too next time they visit.

### Checklists and briefings
Do you always forget what you did last week, or what you're doing this week?
Make a briefing. Do you need to do something like set up recording software, 
bring up a playlist of music, or ask players for feedback? Well, make a
checklist. Fill out this paper or file with info, then bring it up
at the start of each session. This helps if your sessions start right after you
get home from work.

### Quest outline
```
The forbidden bulldog.
1. Locate the bulldog merchant
The merchant can only be found in a shady area around midnight. Flip a coin to
see if two thugs attack the party. Merchant claims he knows how the party can
summon a demon who owns the forbidden bulldog whose jowls are unnaturally
floppy. To share this info, he demands a flower of love from a arcane botanist.
2. Arcane botanist
She lives in a flower shop and is weeping, tells the party her son William had
the flower of love when he was kidnapped by the Billy gang in the market
district.
3. Market District
A guard will pass by, then billy gang member will lean against a wall. He'll
order backup if threatened, but can be bribed or persuaded to brag about beating
William easily before taking him to the abandoned workshop on the edge of town.
4. Abandoned workshop
There are a couple gang members standing guard, but there's a back entrance to
the factory leading to a hallway with two rooms. To the left is an internal grow
station of botanical plants including the flower of love. To the right there are
prisoners including William with ball and chain on their ankles.
5. Demon King's Lair
After the merchant gets his flower, he tells the party the location of the Demon
King's lair, and to tell the statues "hibiscus" to get in. They can summon the
demon by lighting his candles.
```
The above is an example of a quest with 5 sections leading to a dungeon. There's
some opportunity for combat and roleplay, and there's a moral decision whether
to free William and risk fighting the Billy gang, or just take his flower. A 
clever, unscrupulous party might even ask the Billy gang if they can buy a
flower of love to bypass the fourth point. The point is that this takes 5
minutes to jot down, and can become the skeleton of either improvisation or
further prep.

```
Like the above, a dungeon outline/map allows you to know what players are
getting into. Loot, enemies, traps, and puzzle details can be added on the same
sheet, on it's back, or on a separate sheet. The map above took about five
minutes to make.

#### Larger dungeons
And if your dungeon's large? Well, make a map for each floor. Not what floors
and rooms your stairs connect to. Put harder challenges on lower levels, and
put better loot on each. You can either treat each floor(or group of rooms) as
a separate dungeon, or put one massive vault at the lowest level. Try to put
loopiung and branching paths to give players some agency in exploration.

#### Loot
You should budget a gold piece amount for your entire dungeon and keep the loot
in the dungeon close to that budget. This ensures a reward for players, but also
prevents them from accidentally getting too much and trivializing rewards from
future dungeons.

### Combat encounters
If you want to streamline a bit, and you know there are going to be three combat
encounters in your dungeon, you can prep them in advance. Just roll the HP and
initiative for each monster, and make space for an initiative tracker if you're
doing that by hand. If you're using a virtual tabletop, prepare each monster's
token and either make them invisible or position them on another map so that you
can transfer them in when they are needed. If you need an entire battlegrid
drawn for a boss fight, this is also something you can prep in advance.

### PC cheat sheet
If you jot down each player character's name along with their AC,
passive perception, and 

### Pre-rolled checks
You ask for a stealth check, and your player rolls very high or low. Knowing
this, they gain meta-knowledge that their character doesn't necessarily have.
The same can be true for insight checks to detect an NPC's motives. You can put
this on your PC cheat sheet for convenience. Just draw a row for each adventurer
and ten columns. Ask for one roll at a time, filling in a random column

### Playlists
Collect some ambience in advance, and you can provide music to create atmosphere
for whatever's happening. Having a generic exploration and combat music is a
good way to hype up players for combat encounters. You might also have dramatic
music for when intense plot moments are happening. If you want to be extra,
try asking each player for a theme song for their character and playing one of
them during fights or any dramatic solo scenes.

### Image references
These can be for your inspirational purposes, but they are excellent for your
players. Have a cool new monster? Make a sketch on paper or your computer. Have
a new NPC? Use an online image reference. Even a basic image reference can help
prime your players' imaginations. Just try and avoid elements in images that
distract from your setting, such as characters from other franchises or settings
that might pull your players out of the world they're exploring.

### Maps and documents
Want players to know the major landmarks and settlements of your setting? Then
give them a very basic map. Want to give players optional lore dumps? Then make
a "book", a three paragraph body of text summarizing the contents of the book.
Give it to the party member that bought the book whenever they spend an hour
reading the thing. Whatever the point of the book is, sprinkle on some world
details. Are your players wanted for a crime? Put together a wanted poster. Are
they entering a fancy region? Show them a list of laws and fines. Going to a
restaurant? Prepare a menu with prices. If you prep four to five of these things
for an adventure, it can help greatly to feel immersive.

### Minigames
Small diversions that can distract players for a minute or two are fun to
sprinkle in to give a moment of levity or an opportunity to gamble. For
instance, you could do a real game of Blackjack or Poker, or you could just
describe the playing experience and ask for a couple checks. Maybe there's
an arm-wrestling contest that boils down to a simple strength check. Or, maybe
there's a pie-eating contest where parties roll CON saves and are disqualified
when they roll under a set DC and puke. Whatever it is, make simple rules,
simple stakes, and for fun, let the players gamble for items, gold, or favors.
You can either think these up on the fly, or make two or three in advance and
bring one out when players visit a town or shop.

## Roll Tables

### Simple tables
When you have a list of things to pick, and they all have the same
probability. Great for completely random things, like a random color
selection below.

```
+------+--------+
| Roll | Color  |
+------+--------+
|    1 | Red    |
|    2 | Green  |
|    3 | Blue   |
|    4 | Yellow |
+------+--------+
```

### DC Tables
These tables are to adjucate when a character attempts something, and their
modifier makes the task easier. The maximum value for these tables is
usually either 20 or 30, assuming bounded accuracy. If you want to make a call
in the moment, here are a couple guidelines:
- 5 Easy
- 10 Normal
- 15 Difficult
- 20 Extremely difficult

Here's an example of a table for pulling off a horse stunt.
```
+-------+------------------+
| Roll  |      Result      |
+-------+------------------+
| 1     | Broken bone      |
| 2-5   | Painful Wipeout  |
| 6-15  | Barely succeed   |
| 16-18 | Succeed easily   |
| 19-20 | Succeed in style |
+-------+------------------+
```

## Curved tables
2d6 is way different from 1d12. For one, it has 11 values, not 12. More
importantly, there's not the same chance for every outcome. In fact, the closer
to the middle you get, the more likely it is you'll roll that outcome.
This is particularly useful when you want a list with certain options being
far more common than others. If you roll a hundred times, you can expect that
66 of them will land on the middle five options. If you want tables for things
like severe weather or an NPC's first impression of your party. Want your rare
outcomes to be more rare? Try a 3d6, and you'll see a 0.46% chance on the
farthest extremes.


```
+------+-------------+
| Roll | Probability |
+------+-------------+
|    2 | 2.77%       |
|    3 | 5.55%       |
|    4 | 8.33%       |
|    5 | 11.11%      |
|    6 | 13.88%      |
|    7 | 16.66%      |
|    8 | 13.88%      |
|    9 | 11.11%      |
|   10 | 8.33%       |
|   11 | 5.55%       |
|   12 | 2.77%       |
+------+-------------+
```

## Hit Points

### Fuzzy Hitpoints
Monsters generally have a hit point formula and average value. You may choose
to track damage, rather than health. When your monster hits it's minimum hit
points worth of damage, but before it hits the max hit points worth of damage,
you can have wiggle room to let the monster die. This works well if you want
to introduce a bit more or less difficulty, allowing the party to either
get in an extra attack or a bility, or else to trade a defeat for a close call.
This is very much dice fudging.

### Hearts
Swap out your monster's hit points with some hearts and some arbitrary value
for how many hit points is in one heart. When your players make an attack
dealing enough to take out a heart, erase a heart. This reduces calculations
and reduces the effect of high-damage attacks, while increasing the effect of
low-damage attacks that are still larger than the heart size.

## Clocks

### Event Calendars
Want some random environmental detail?
Make a calendar, appropriate to your campaign (a couple months to a year is
common). You don't need to add an event to every day, but the following
information can make all the difference to making the world feel living and
breathing. You can generate these by hand with dice, or write a script.
Either way, keep track of the day as a number (from 1 to the last day in the
year) and have a lookup table to find information for the day.
- Day of the week - (to track weekly events like church, payday, weekend)
- Day of the month - (to track seasons)
- Lunar cycle (full moons, new moons, maybe even blue or blood moons)
- Weather (rain, flooding, wind, snow, cold, heat, dry streak)
- Holidays (who celebrates, what are they celebrating, how?)
- World events (science discovery, fashion trend, election)
- Plot events (big bad evil guy's plans advance, heists pulled off, assassinations)

### Progress Clocks
Draw a circle. Now draw some lines until you have N slices.
Every time X happens, color in one of the slices. When they are all
filled in, then Y happens. That's a progress clock.

Here's some examples:
Aggrevation clock, ticks when you annoy the NPC, when it's full they're done talking.
Interest clock, ticks when you make the NPC more interested in your timeshare
opportunity. When it's full, they're interested in meeting in a tavern and
discussing it at length(while the rest of the party ransacks the NPC's house).

Note that you could run two clocks at once. Maybe you want to convince the
NPC, but avoid annoying him.

Also works well as a doomsday counter for event-based plot arcs.

## Experience Points


## Side quests
In addition to your main plot, you might want to set up short side quests to
lend agency to what your party pursues in the world. Sandbox play can be made
up entirely of exploration that reveals side quests.

### Modular quests

### Hook
Let's say you want your players to go fight the king of demons. You prep the
encounter for the king of demons, and then you make three hooks. Your party
finds someone claiming to have the forbidden bulldog, but it's actually just
a dressed up regular bulldog. You go to a tavern and there's rumors about people
who never came back after they went to fight the king of demons for his dog.
If the party talks about it in public, a guard will claim only rabblerousers
talk about the demon king, and ask if the party's affiliated with the shady
merchants that come around here at night. If the party doesn't bite after those
hooks, then drop that chunk of content, and maybe reincorporate it into another
dungeon or adventure.

### Goal Cards
A card with a goal such as "defeat the king of demons" and a reward such as
"the forbidden bulldog". If your players are bored, slap one down on the table.
If someone talks about wanting to do something for pure plot reasons, create one
on the spot and slap it down. This keeps motivation on the table by making sure
the game rewards players for being invested in stuff.

### Fuzzy geography
If your location isn't marked on the player-facing map, will the players notice
if it moves? Of course not! Provided you don't contradict anything you've
established thus far(like putting a giant spire in plain view of the starting
city, but conveniently never mentioning it until now), knock yourself out!
You can plan multiple dungeons separate from or in advance of a campaign and
give them out using goal


# Making Monsters

## What is a monster?
A monster's an excuse for your players to use all their characters' combat
abilities. They often provide an unambiguous evil, something that would make
the world safer or better if killed. Other times, they are merely dangerous
things that are better left alone and can be avoided. Lastly, people can fill
the role of monsters. There might not be anything monstrous about a commoner,
thief, or, guard, but they are combatants that can fight against the party
under certain circumstances.

A monster ideally provides a challenge to your party. A challenge that can be
instantly solved by expending class resources or using an abilities provides
player characters with a chance to be uniquely useful in a situation. Equally,
a challenge which cannot be instantly solved by abilities is a good way to test
the player's lateral thinking and provide some novelty. After fighting a novel
monster once, the players will know what to do with subsequent monsters of this
type and you can use that in your dungeon design.

## Archetypes
By shifting around stats, you'll often find monsters fitting into groups.
Feel free to make your own, or mix two. Go wild, as variety is the spice of
life.

### Goon
Weak, frail, and numerous, goons are often either foot soldiers or part of a
hoard. Players will get a rush from being able to one-hit these creatures, but
they are not terribly interesting otherwise.

### Strikers
Your party may slowly chew away a bunch of goons. Throwing a striker in changes
that dynamic. A striker is a monster that is highly mobile, and which deals
higher damage than a goon. Archers, assassins, and creatures with stealth
abilities fit into this category well. These monsters will motivate your party
to prioritize them in favor of goons, and will.

### Glass Cannons
A glass cannon may be worse stat-wise than a goon in every way except firepower.
While they cannot take a beating, they sure can dish one out. They will be able
to deliver their damage from a distance, and are thus likely guarded by other
monsters.

### Tanks
Tanks absorb damage. Their regular damage should be higher than goons. Their
hit points, armor class, or both, will be boosted. A high AC ensures that the
creature cannot be easily felled by melee and ranged weapon attacks.

### Debuffer
A monster that can grapple, immobilize, or otherwise cause an effect on a target
presents a unique challenge. They will often have abilities that nullify the
abilities of the PCs, such as an anti-magic field, tentacles that prevent melee
attacks, or abilities that damage the target multiple rounds and challenges
concentration. It is often good to make whatever effects these monsters produce
end when said creature loses concentration or dies. This gives the party
a way to solve the problem introduced. Sometimes, however, you can make monsters
scary by giving them a debuff that can't easily be reversed, even after the
fight.

### Boss
Some monsters are intended to be a spectacle to fight. Bosses need to be able
to take hits. They often have legendary actions, which are taken on a player's
turn when specific triggers(such as falling below half health) are hit. This
buffs action economy a bit so that one creature can face three or four PCs. Some
bosses might have multiple forms that have entirely different stat blocks. This
might be true of a demon that leaves it's human form to become a grotesque
spider monstern when it first takes damage, or a cultist leader with powerful
buffs once it completes a ritual after 1d4 turns of combat.

## Design workflow
0. Provide a short description of where this creature is found, and what it
does that's noteworthy. Describe it's appearance or draw a picture.
1. Boil the monster down to an archetype and one or two descriptors.
2. Determine general HP, AC, ability scores, and speed according to archetype.
3. Add one to three abilities specific to archetype and descriptors.
4. If it's a magic user, add two to three spells.

# Building encounters

## What is an encounter?
An encounter is a short(30 seconds to 10 minute) chunk of game content that
your players interact with. You can plan encounters in advance, or create them
in the moment. Some examples:
- a bouncer won't let the party into a club
- Passing an area full of pit traps
- Passing through a den of sleeping wolves
- tight-roping over a pit of alligators
- Solving a puzzle to open a door
- Hunting and foraging for more food in the wild
- Scaling a castle wall to kill the sentinel at the top
- Guards carry off a man who was stirring trouble in a tavern the party left

## What is an encounter made of?
In it's most minimal form, an encounter can simply be an **experience** for the
party that makes the world seem more real, or gives **knowledge** about how it
operates. More than that, an encounter could involve a **goal** such as getting
to the other side of a room, getting a shiny gem, or surviving. There's then an
**obstacle** that the party needs to overcome such as a bouncer, a case that
will not open until a riddle is solved, or a horde of skeletons. Many obstacles
can be dealt with using skillchecks or combat. One easy way to remedy this is
to incorporate a **complication** of some sort. Complications can either change
the stakes of an encounter (sneaking through a den of wolves VS a den of lions),
or it can change viable options. For instance, a fight taking place in an area
with a flammable gas leak means a bad outcome if you use fire or lightning
magic. A fight where killing your opponent will bring the local guard against
you and get you shunned by merchants and innkeepers is a fight where you won't
be able to use your normal ranged weapons and fireball spell. The players will
then need to get crafty and work around the resulting **limitations**. On that
note, an encounter may present **choices**. When a player sees an obstacle, what
options will they see to overcome it, and which will they pick? Limitations work
by subverting their expectations and shaking up default choices. If a player
picks the same choice every single time, it stops being a choice. Very lastly,
an encounter may involve **resource depletion**. Whenever an item is expended or
a spell is cast, that's one less item/spell to use on the next encounter. 

## Failure
Your party member tries to jump a gap. They fail an acrobatics check, and are
now rolling a new character. Your party can't solve the riddle and literally
cannot finish the dungeon. Consider your failure states. If your failure state
ends the game, then the fun stops there. This can be alright if those are the
stakes your party agrees to. Most often, though, you'll want a failure state
that leaves opportunity to try again.

### Fail foward
The adventurer jumps a gap, tumbles down, and their bag snags on a root jutting
from the pit's wall. The bag's strap is tearing and they need to react quickly.
They succeed in pulling themself up onto the other side, but their bag tears
open and the first 6 items in their inventory tumbles down into the abyss below.
They narrowly avoided death, but they are worse for the wear. Maybe the party
knows that the answer to the riddle can be found in a pit of skeletons, or can
be bought by an NPC who will solve it patronisingly or demand a favor. This may
offer some unpleasantness and preserve the distinction between overcoming a
failure and succeeding initially, but still allow the players to win.

## Fun combat
Take a look at all the bold words in the "What is an encounter made of?"
section. If you want your fights to feel different, focus on some of those
words.

### Flavor(experience)
Like a dolphin, leap into the air with mechanics. Maybe your player says "I
attack with a my shortsword. 17, 6 damage." That kills the goblin, sure. You
could say "That hits, killing the goblin." You could also use one of many
other descriptions for this. Note that these are gratuitiously violent, so make
sure the ferocity matches that of the player. Some players will be disgusted by
this, but others will feel a rush of adrenaline as their attack plays out like
a scene in an action movie. 
"You stab into the goblin and see the red sword tip surface from it's back. It
lets out a hushed groan, then falls lifeless off your blade."
"The goblin grabs your arm and tries to wrench the blade from you, but you end
the struggle by bashing it's head on the nearby cement wall, killing it."
"You make a quick jab and the goblin falls, clutching it's throat."
"The goblin hisses and jumps at you, but you draw your blade and it collides
with the tip. Clawwing at arm's length, the creature suddenly falls limp against
you."

### Novelty(complications)
The first time the players fight a troll that can only be killed with fire, it
can be terrifying to figure it out. If you want to keep things fresh, throw in
new enemies with the existing ones, or reskin existing enemies.

### Environment(choices, limitations)
The second time players fight a troll that can only be killed with fire, the
mystery will be solved and the novelty gone. Introduce new elements, like nearby
barrels of blasting powder, or a natural gas vent, or a field of dry grass. The
combat is trivialized, but in a cool way that satisfies power fantasy. You can
go in the opposite direction by fighting said trolls in the pouring rain where
fire magic is less effective (has disadvantage or deals half damage), or maybe
this takes place underwater where fire damage does not work. The goal at that
point might change from killing the trolls, to getting past or escaping them. An
enemy that is clearly too strong for the party can likewise work this way,
acting as an obstacle that must be avoided and retreated from.

### lasting effects (complications, resource depletion)
Maybe a creature isn't scary because they will kill a member of the party, but
because one bite will give them a disease from the book of maladies. Maybe a
wolf attacks a character during one round and tears their backpack instead of
downing them? I would advise against doing either of these too much, as they
might make combat seem tedious if every fight gave you an STD, or
inconsequential if every time a character's about to go down, something
conveniently prevents that from happening. A little goes a long way toward
keeping things fresh and different.

# Your first adventure

## Step 1: Pick your format
A oneshot would be trivial, so I'll select episodic. We're assuming your table
will meet weekly for a month or two, giving us 8 sessions. If you can't meet
that frequently, then this might span four or eight months instead. You may
have people drop in or out, and that's fine due to the episodic nature, provided
you have enough characters to actually run a session each time you meet.

## Step 2: Pick your premise
I'm going to say monster of the day. Your campaign will span about 7 episodes
and conclude with a season finale. If everything's successful, you can create
a second season.

## Step 3: Design your plot
This is the bulk of your worldbuilding. Who are the party? What kind of problems
do they solve? The party are members of the adventurer's guild, and they are
called in to solve strange problems that they are uniquely equipped to handle
with the best cost effectivity, never accepting pay until they succeed. Your
characters live in the land of the Iron Lance, a kingdom. Say one interesting
thing about this place. It resides on an island and the king made a deal with
the god of the ocean, so the island has been unreachable by foreign ships for
the last century. In this state of peace, the Iron Lance no longer has a
professional military of any capacity. Ok, now let's name an antagonist. The
king of demons wants this island for himself, and so sends demons to wreak
havoc on the island with the goal of being summoned there. As a lesser threat,
let's say there's a cult doing the summoning.

## Step 4: Break your content out into pieces
Wow, that's intimidating. Where do we start? With the bones, of course!
Let's describe this story in 8 pieces. Each episode will contain a monster of
the week, and one bit of plot. We'll ratchet up the tension as we go. The party
will start by fighting demons that seem to be teleporting in and leaving demonic
glyphs at their entry points. Each demon will be fighting over a spot where a
gem is hidden, uncovering it before the fight. Eventually, the party will get
evidence that these glyphs are being drawn by people. They'll get a session
where they figure out the location of a cult cell. At some point, the cultists
will attack the adventurer's guild where the gems are stored while the party is
out fighting a demon. Lastly, the finale where the party is contracted to stop
the cult from summoning the king of demons. Ok, let's break this into episodes.
- Fire Demon (demon dies to reveal gem)
- Rabbit Demon (demon actively breaks a statue to steal a gem)
- Tooth Demon(locals claim they saw someone draw the glyphs)
- Eyeball Demon(cultist caught drawing rune, captured)
- Raid on Cult cell
- House Demon, cult raids adventurer's guild
- Season Finale: King of Demons

## Step 5: Fine details
Maybe I'll make this actual campaign some day so you can reference it, but I'll
give you advice right now. Build a rigid formula and apply it to the first four
episodes. Then break that formula to help drive home the building of tension by
taking away the comfort of the familiar pattern. The pattern might fit a 
five room dungeon like this:

0. 30 second song or spoken intro
1. The patron gives their best briefing of the demon and the city it's near.
2. The party has to track down the demon by investigating townsfolk and clues.
3. New demon reveals evidence of it's power or traps.
4. Party faces the demon.
5. The demon drops a gem, the patron buys it.
6. 30 second song or spoken outro

## Wilderness travel methods
Feel free to mix and match these, as they may be appropriate.

### Combat Focused
This technique works best for short travels, or those that are in particularly
dangerous. The focus is heavily put on resource management. This adds tension
when the party is in dangerous land and needs to cross distance.

Each day, the party consumes 1 pound of food, 1 gallon of water, and must set
camp. For the day, and for the night, ask every player to roll a 1d20. Assume
that water is available for anyone who has water containers.

If any of the rolls is below the DC, then there's a combat. The DC is generally
1, but can be shifted to give different odds. Below is a table for a party
of four rolling, showing probability of avoiding a fight.

```
+----+----------------+
| DC | Success Chance |
+----+----------------+
|  1 | 81.45%         |
|  2 | 65.61%         |
|  3 | 52.2%          |
|  4 | 40.96%         |
|  5 | 31.64%         |
+---------+-----------+
```

For extra dimension, you can roll for the distance when the combat is detected.

```
+------+---------------------+
| Roll |      Distance       |
+------+---------------------+
|    1 | Melee-ranged Ambush |
|    2 | Ranged Ambush       |
|    3 | 100 feet            |
|    4 | 500 feet            |
|    5 | Mile                |
|    6 | More than a mile    |
+------+---------------------+
```


### Environment Focused
This technique works best for long travels that you don't want to linger too
heavily on. For every day of travel, add a 1d6 to your pool.
Roll them in order, jotting down which days have a 1 or 2.


Each 1 is a combat encounter, and each 2 is a travel complication.

You'll want to stock your own combat encounters to choose from,
but here's a 1d20 table of some complications.

```
+------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Roll |                               Travel Complication                               |
+------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

|    5 | All of your rations spoil.                                                      |
|    6 | Other travelers in need.                                                        |
|    7 | A fire, earthquake, or tornado.                                                 |

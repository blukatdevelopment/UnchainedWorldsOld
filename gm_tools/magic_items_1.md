### Spell-stealing Wand
This wand has a cover that you can slide open to reveal a hidden compartment.
If you open the compartment within 10ft of a spellcaster when they cast a spell,
that spell is stored in the wand instead of being cast. You may then cast the
spell at a later time, which has a +2 modifier and a spell DC of 12. This wand
can only store one spell, which is expended when you cast it.

### Shooting star wand
When you cast a spell with an attack roll, this spell deals an additional 1d4
force damage as it fires tiny shooting stars as part of the attack. If you
roll a natural 1 with this wand on an attack roll, the wand produces sparks
instead of casting.

## Weapons

deals half damage to you instead.

attack.

### Bleeding Heart Dagger
When you attack someone with this blade, the target begins recounting every
failed or unrealized relationship in their life, ruminating on it. They must
make a DC 13 wisdom saving throw, or take 1d4 psychic damage.

### Froggy Staff
Magical quarterstaff
Has 3 charges that restore at dawn. You may expend one charge in order to 
jump 30 feet either as a long jump or a high jump. If you drop the froggy staff,
it produces a loud frog's croak audible for up to 120 feet.

### Cluster Crossbow
This special light crossbow fires four crossbow bolts simultaneously.
When you target a creature with it within normal range, the creature must
succeed a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. If you fire past normal range, the
creature has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the creature receives
normal damage.

## Armor

### Cherryblossom Shield
Has one charge which restores each day. As a reaction to being targeted with
a melee attack, you can release a flurry of cherryblossoms from this shield
which will cause the attack to be made with disadvantage.

### Miner's Helm
This helmet has a built-in bullseye lantern that can be switched on and off
with a command word. The flame is magical and does not consume fuel.

### Flowering Cloak
This cloak is covered in flowers that attract butterflies and moths. It confers
advantage on animal handling checks.

### Frog-eyed Necklace
This necklace consists of twine with a frog eye hanging from it.
Requires attunement. When worn by the attuned creature, provides advantage
on perception checks. However, you become hypervigialent of bugs. If you are
in the presence of bugs, you must succeed a DC 15 wisdom saving throw or attempt
to eat one of the bugs.

### Croak Cloak
When you pull the hood of this green cloak over your head, your skin turns green
and slick with mucus. You have advantage on checks made to avoid being grappled.
Your fingers become webbed. You gain a swimming speed equal to your normal speed.

### Visor of Doom
When you wear this helmet, your eyes glow bright red.

### Cocao Heavy Armor
This +1 heavy armor maintains a toasty warm temperature, even in extremely hot
or cold environments. When you take damage, make a DC 12 constitution saving
throw. On a failure, the armor fails to regulate heat and burns you, dealing
1d4 fire damage.

### +1 armor
This armor has a +1 bonus to the AC of the wearer.

### +2 armor
This armor has a +2 bonus to the AC of the wearer.

### +3 armor
This armor has a +3 bonus to the AC of the wearer.

### Jump Suit
This half plate has jets on the back that produce blue flame to propel the
wearer into the air. It has 6 charges, which return at dawn. When active,
the suit consumes one charge per round of combat and confers a 60ft flying speed
to the wearer.

## Consumables

### Exploding Shuriken
This throwing star shares proficiency with darts. If you throw this shuriken
and hit a target, it sticks into them. Speaking the command word with a bonus
action causes the shuriken to explode, which forces all creatures within 10ft
of the target to make a dex saving throw. On a failure they take 3d6 fire
damage, and half as much on a success.

### Fin Candy
When you eat this grey fin-shaped candy, you find that it is sweet with a
leathery, gummy texture. Your head transforms into that of a hammerhead shark,
allowing you to breathe underwater for 1 hour.

## Miscellaneous

### Pulse Orb
The pulse orb is a sticky blue globe of gel. When you activate it, it strobes
slowly, producing a bright light each time it strobes on. It strobes on for 6
seconds, and then off for 6 seconds, alternating. You may stick the
strobe to a surface or a creature, and it can be thrown up to 30 feet. While
strobed on, it produces bright light for 30 feet and dim light for an additional
30 feet.

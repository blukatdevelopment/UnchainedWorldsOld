# Southhorn

## Foreword
This adventure module is suitable for adventurers from level 0-3, and will
provide them with a starting point for a larger campaign. In this adventure
the party will find themselves confronted with a choice to side with the
kingdom of Inglewood that is occupying the city of Southhorn, or the criminals
living beneath it.

## The Diadem
Inglewood's first ship 


## Southhorn
Southhorn was founded by a band of thieves who raised it's port to service
pirate ships. Positioned between the warring Omarian and Inglewood kingdoms in
an unclaimed area, the land quickly expanded. Refugees of the wars as well as
those that didn't fit into the general society of either kingdom made a home for
themselves in Southhorn, which welcomed them with open arms. This independence
was disturbed by a sudden and decisive invasion by the Inglewood royal army that
culminated in the death of the leader of the thieves, known only as The Jackal.
Since then, the temple of light has been renovated, changed to the temple of
stoicism, the illicit markets have been scrubbed clean, and the port now
services the first ship of Inglewood's royal navy.

Many of the residents fled after the occupation, but many more moved
underground into the tunnels built by uprooted dwarves and kobolds. While the
Duke of Inglewood knows of the underground, he's nonetheless unprepared to
launch an invasion of the tunnels, instead opting to lay seige to the
vast tunnel network. It is a well-known secret that The Jackal did not die in
the invasion, and is hidden somewhere in the depths of the underground, raising
a resistance despite the seige.

### 20 Dwarven Feast Hall
A table of nobles sit around a feast hall, infected with leech crawlers.
The infected will act calmly and collectedly, fully assimilated. The dutchess,
infected with the parasites, will thank the adventurers for rescuing them and
offer a 300GP reward for their safe return to the surface. They will raise it to
600GP if the party doesn't take the offer or sees through it. If pressed, they
will argue that their noble hosts were already evil before being overtaken, and
that the two kingdoms have warred for a hundred years so far, meaning any evil
they can do is inconsequential.

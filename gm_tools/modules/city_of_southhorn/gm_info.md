## Southhorn
Southhorn was founded by a band of thieves who raised it's port to service
pirate ships. Positioned between the warring Omarian and Inglewood kingdoms in
an unclaimed area, the land quickly expanded. Refugees of the wars as well as
those that didn't fit into the general society of either kingdom made a home for
themselves in Southhorn, which welcomed them with open arms. This independence
was disturbed by a sudden and decisive invasion by the Inglewood royal army that
culminated in the death of the leader of the thieves, known only as The Jackal.
Since then, the temple of light has been renovated, changed to the temple of
stoicism, the illicit markets have been scrubbed clean, and the port now
services the first ship of Inglewood's royal navy.

Many of the residents fled after the occupation, but many more moved
underground into the tunnels built by uprooted dwarves and kobolds. While the
Duke of Inglewood knows of the underground, he's nonetheless unprepared to
launch an invasion of the tunnels, instead opting to lay seige to the
vast tunnel network. It is a well-known secret that The Jackal did not die in
the invasion, and is hidden somewhere in the depths of the underground, raising
a resistance despite the seige.


### (a) Barracks
Wrapped with a palisade of sharpened timber, the barracks contains an archery
range, small stables, and jail cells on the West side, while the East side is
dominated by a large tower used to quarter the town guard.

#### Archery Range
The guard and Inglewood forces may use this location to train in archery with
a shortbow or light crossbow. If an adventurer spends a day training here, they
may make a DC 15 investigation check to learn to use the weapon they are
training with, gaining proficiency on a success.

#### Stables
The guard and Inglewood forces may rent a warhorse for 2gp per day. If the
rented horse dies, or the adventurers wish to outright purchase one, they pay
30GP.

#### Jail Cells
There are three wooden cells. Thieves and beggars find themselves here most
often.

#### Tower
The tower has four floors
1. Mess hall strewn with tables, ale kegs, and bounty board.
2. Bunk room with weapons and 1d100SP per lock chest
3. Armory that sells swords, pikes, and light crossbows, shields to Inglewood forces
4. Roof

```
Bounty Board
+--------+-----------------------+
| Bounty |        Target         |
+--------+-----------------------+
|      5 | Right ear of a bandit |
|     50 | Red Paw leader        |
|    100 | Cultist Leader        |
+--------+-----------------------+
```

### (b) Temple of Bimros
The temple features iconography of Uaos, god of the beast folk. There are
animals carved into the walls, but Uaos's pawprint above the entrance and at the
altar has been replaced with Bimros's arrow pointing diagonally up and right.

may captivate the crowd, convincing Cossot to give them a free room for the
night. Performing well earns 3d100CP in tips.

#### Basement Trade
If the party asks Cossot about underground items, she'll offer to lead them into
the basement. Once inside, she'll offer them her hidden wares. If they threaten
to expose her operation, she'll gleefully inform them that the guards already
know and are paid off, which explains her high prices.

- find the group that went underground (Room 2 in dungeon) and report back

### (j) Count Kinkade's Manor
There's a total of 50 guards protecting the property at any given time.
If the guard is called, groups of 1d4+1 will come each turn of combat to
fight a beligerant party. If the party runs, two horseback guards will
be on their trail within 10 minutes.

If the party comes by invitation, they may stay in the guest house and
access the amenities of the manor each day (8 amenities). Kinkade(M) will
talk to them while attending feasts, balls, jousts, etc to discuss
their next orders.

that one of them will turn into a leech zombie and attack during each visit.
If the party attempts to bring the victims to the surface, they will grow
hostile and violently resist due to voices in their heads.

angry if one is not provided.

Grinder
This spherical demon opens into two hemisphers joined by a central stalk. Teeth
brim at the edges where these pieces meet, forming a 360 degree mouth. Grinders
gnash their teeth constantly, compelled to chew through stone despite the pain 
it causes them. They have eyes on all sides, and three legs.

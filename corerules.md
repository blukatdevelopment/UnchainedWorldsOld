# Foreword

### What is Unchained Worlds?
Unchained Worlds is a tabletop roleplaying game designed with the intention of providing a table of three to seven people tools, rules, and content to participate in the three pillars of exploration, combat, and roleplaying. Unchained Worlds differs from most competing games in that it is neither a clone of an existing game, nor is it designed as a commercial product. Unchained Worlds is both free as in free beer and free as in freedom. It’s content is deliberately modular and self-contained in order to make the process of selecting, using, and authoring content easy. 

### Why Unchained Worlds?
Unchained Worlds is built with “less is more” as its motto. Character customization options are slim, hit points are low for monsters and adventurers, and levels are capped at 10. This lends itself to low power play wherein a party of players must carefully consider the consequences for their actions and use lateral thinking to overcome obstacles and limitations. The worlds explored with this system are intended to be gritty and dangerous places where decision-making and roleplaying is more important than character build. While this system can be used for linear epic campaigns and for combat-focused power gaming, such play is not the primary concern.

### How do I play Unchained Worlds?
At your table, one person assumes the role of Game Master. They create the world that is explored, control non-player characters(henceforth NPC), and referee combat and player interaction with the world. All other people at the table are players, who each control a player character. Player characters (henceforth PCs) explore the world, interact with NPCs, and fight. There may be a linear campaign designed for the players to explore, or there may be a sandbox world that is explored according to the player’s interests.


# Creating your character
This handbook provides a skeletal set of character creation options, and are not intended for use in normal campaigns. Work with your game master to determine what supplemental books you will use when creating your characters.

## Abilities

### What are abilities?
When you attempt to perform a task that involves natural ability or skill, your abilities help determine the odds of success. Here’s a breakdown of what different abilities govern.

#### Strength
Lift, climb, carry, grapple, throw, punch, and perform tasks that require brute force.

#### Dexterity
Sprint, jump, duck, dodge, sneak, and perform acrobatic maneuvers.

#### Constitution
Resist the effects of poison, toxins, fatigue, and illness. Determines your maximum hit points.

#### Intelligence
Process, calculate, and reason through complex information. 

#### Wisdom
Intuit, deduce, and read between the lines. Particularly good for resisting mind-altering magic, reading the intentions of others, and perceiving the world around you.

#### Charisma
Joke, flatter, persuade, lie, bluff, perform, and intimidate others. Useful wherever talking or looking good is needed.

### What are ability scores?
An ability score is a number ranging from 1 to 20 which quantifies your ability’s potency. When making an ability check, you roll a 1d20 and add the ability’s modifier. To calculate the ability modifier, take half the distance from 10, rounded down. Here’s a chart.

```
+-------+----------+
| Score | Modifier |
+-------+----------+
| 20    | +5       |
| 18-19 | +4       |
| 16-17 | +3       |
| 14-15 | +2       |
| 12-13 | +1       |
| 10-11 | 0        |
| 8-9   | -1       |
| 6-7   | -2       |
| 4-5   | -3       |
| 2-3   | -4       |
| 1     | -5       |
+-------+----------+
```

### Generating ability scores

#### Predetermined arrays
If you do not want to trust your fate to the dice, you may use an array of predetermined values. Values are not provided in order, and can be assigned arbitrarily. Work with your DM to determine which of these will work for your campaign, if any.
Standard array: [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]
Min-max array: [17, 14, 13, 11, 9, 7]
Commoner array: [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
Demigod array: [18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18]

#### Roll scores
If you trust your fate to the dice gods, this is your ritual. You will discover your character, for better or worse. Roll 4d6. Set aside the lowest roll and ignore it. Add up the remaining three. This is your strength score. Repeat this process for the other five abilities. When you’re done, you may switch the scores of two abilities. You may do this only for one pair of abilities.

## Skills
Every character has a proficiency bonus which increases with level progression. This proficiency bonus is added to checks made that utilize said skill.

### Specific Skills
Specific skills define a very narrow action, like agriculture, tracking, or poetry. They are not defined exhaustively, and can be added by supplementary books.

### General Skills
Some skills are general in nature, and may apply to a wide variety of situations. When a feat, lineage, or class grants you proficiency in a skill, it will likely be in general skills. They are listed explicitly below.
- Acrobatics
- Animal Handling
- Arcana
- Arcana
- Athletics
- Deception
- History
- Insight
- Intimidation
- Investigation
- Medicine
- Nature
- Perception
- Performance
- Persuasion
- Performance
- Persuasion
- Religion
- Sleight of Hand
- Stealth
- Survival

## Lineage
Your lineage describes both the physical traits and cultural traditions handed down to you by your ancestors. Naturally, these details are mutable. That said, here’s the unskilled human.

### Human
**Languages:** Common
**Size:** Medium
**Speed:** 30 feet
**Ability Score Increase:** +1 to each ability score
Choose one of the following:
- **Actor:** You have advantage on charisma checks made when trying to act as a different person. If you have heard a creature speak or make a sound for at least one minute, you may now speak like them or mimic the sound. Other creatures can contest (insight vs deception) this speech or sound to determine it’s fake.
- **Charger:** You can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or shove a creature when you use your action to dash. If you have just moved at least 10 feet in a straight line, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack’s damage roll or push the target up to 10 feet away from you if you successfully shove the target.
- **Crossbow Expert:** You can ignore the loading quality of crossbows, provided you are proficient with them. You no longer have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls as a result of being within 5 feet of a hostile creature. You may use a bonus action to attack with a hand crossbow after using your action to attack with a one-handed weapon.
- **Linguist:** You learn three languages of your choice.
- **Mobile:** Your base speed increases by ten feet. When you dash, difficult terrain doesn’t cost extra movement on that turn. After you make a melee attack against a creature, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn regardless of whether you hit.
- **Alert:** Your initiative rolls gain a +5 bonus, you cannot be surprised while conscious, and other creatures don’t gain advantage on attack rolls made against you as a result of being unseen by you.

## Background
Your background describes the life you had before you began adventuring. It decides your societal status, skills, and general level of wealth. A brief backstory which describes the following elements works well:
1. How did this background shape your character?
2. Why did your character leave their background?
3. What relationships, if any, does your character have with the other player characters.
The one background provided is the farmer.

### Farmer
You bent your back under a blazing sun to till the land and raise a crop.
**Skills:** agriculture, proficiency with sickles
**Items:** Common clothes, a sickle, a chicken, a 30lb sack of wheat berries, and a pouch containing 5 silver pieces

## Class
Your class decides your hit dice, class features, and informs the role you'll play in your party.
The commoner class is provided below, but is not recommended for normal games.

### Commoner
You are average, bland, and unremarkable. You don't wield magic, and you aren't great with swords.
And yet, here you are.

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** None
**Weapons:** Club, dagger
**Saving throws**: Constitution

#### Skills
Choose 2 from the following: Athletics, Insight, History, Nature, Religion

#### Starting Equipment
- club
- either a. 5 torches or b. waterskin

|     7 | 3d6      | +3                |        600 |                   |
|     8 | 3d6      | +3                |        700 |                   |
|     9 | 3d6      | +3                |        800 |                   |
|    10 | 3d6      | +3                |        900 | Training Montage  |
+-------+----------+-------------------+------------+-------------------+
```


#### Bonus Proficiency
When you gain this feature at level 3, you may gain one of the following:
- Proficiency with one simple weapon
- Proficiency with two general skills

#### (Optional) Training Montage
You have survived long enough as a commoner. Remove all your class features
and hit dice (this resets your max HP to 0). Retain any proficiencies and
equipment. You lose all levels in commoner. Choose a class other than commoner.
You are now level 1 in the chosen class.

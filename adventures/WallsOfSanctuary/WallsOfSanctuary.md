## Cast

### King Baruti III
Baruti III is a plump, gregarious human dressed in royal robes and a Uraeus made
from the tanned hide of a giant cobra. He carries a dagger made from dragon
steel, which deals an extra 1d4 fire damage.


### Mardus, chief advisor to the king
Murdus is an elderly human man dressed in silk gown and adorned with golden
jewelry. He is straight to the point and has little humor, though he is very
cynical and thinks poorly of those working with him.

### Aleris the palm reader
A street magician woman named Aleris wears a cloak with a hood that casts her
face in shadow. Underneath she wears dark makeup around her eyes covering runes.
She speaks slowly and with great grandure, using vague language when possible.

## Setup
Have the party all come up with some details about their character.

### Claim to fame
What was your story that finally made you a famous adventurer?
Roll a 1d4. On even, you helped someone. On odd, you hurt them.
Who are they, and how did you affect them?

### Rumors
Each player will receive one rumor about their character from each player.
The player will choose one rumor that's true and tell only the GM.

## Gadget
The king's chief advisor recruits the party to act as a covert special mission squad.
Recently, a relic known as the Wheel of Holar was stolen en route to Sanctuary.
Only the king's men knew of this mission, so this is a conspiracy.
- Interrogate suspects, determine where the relic is
- Retrieve the relic

### The Royal Palace
Each member of the party receives a letter that reads as follows.
```
Noble adventurer,
It is with the king's honor that you have been summoned to partake in
festivities at the royal palace. Your reputation precedes you, and as such your
skills are desired by the king. Tidy yourself and arrive at the Eastern gates
at dusk. I eagerly await our meeting of minds.
Honor to the king,
Mardus, chief advisor to the king

#### Palm Reading
Aleris the palm reader will try to ask the party for a moment of their time
to lend their palms to her that she might read their fortune. If someone
volunteers, she reads their palm and then asks them if they would like to
know what it says.
```
"Your near future will invite tragedy, but if you are wise you
may transform it to achieve greatness."
```
Once she tells them, she'll ask for 10gp as payment.

If they pay, she'll give them a one-time blessing they can use in the next week.
If they deny her or attempt to haggle, she'll mark them with a curse instead.
The blessing or curse will appear on their body as a rune tattoo, and will fade
after it expires or is remedied.

#### Gates
At the Eastern gates two guards(Akil, Fenuku) wielding golden quarterstalves
fashioned like cobras will demand the party explains themselves before they
can proceed. If the party asks, they'll get directions to the private
celebration.

#### Halls of the palace
The halls wind and fork, twisting back into themselves in a maze that one can
easily be lost in.

#### Royal introduction
Mardus will introduce each of the party members, telling of the story that
brought them here.


### Interrogate the suspects


#### Ianmorn Boldspan
A gnome man who headed the engineering efforts of the relic mission.

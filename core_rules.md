# Foreword

### What is Unchained Worlds?
Unchained Worlds is a tabletop roleplaying game designed with the intention of providing a table of three to seven people with tools, rules, and content to participate in Unchained World's three pillars of exploration, combat, and roleplaying. Unchained Worlds differs from most competing games in that it is neither a clone of an existing game, nor is it designed as a commercial product. Unchained Worlds is both free as in free beer and free as in freedom. It’s content is deliberately modular and self-contained in order to make the process of selecting, using, and authoring content easy. 

### Why Unchained Worlds?
Unchained Worlds is built with “less is more” as its motto. Character customization options are slim, hit points are low for monsters and adventurers, and levels are capped at 10. This lends itself to low power play wherein a party of players must carefully consider the consequences for their actions and use lateral thinking to overcome obstacles and limitations. The worlds explored with this system are intended to be gritty and dangerous places where decision-making and roleplaying is more important than character build. While this system can be used for linear epic campaigns and for combat-focused power gaming, such play is not the primary concern.

### How do I play Unchained Worlds?
At your table, one person assumes the role of keeper. They create the world that is explored, control non-player characters(henceforth NPC), and referee combat and player interaction with the world. All other people at the table are players, who each control a player character. Player characters (henceforth PCs) explore the world, interact with NPCs, and fight. There may be a linear campaign designed for the players to explore, or there may be a sandbox world that is explored according to the player’s interests.

# Philosophy
Make sure your group agrees with what's written here before you take it too seriously. If your table's opinionated, they'll probably have their own version that better reflects their philosophy. If they're clever, they'll just change this section and take out this warning.
That said, let's dive in.

## Safety Tools
For better and worse, everyone brings their unique life experiences to the table. This can help to enrich the game with a variety of perspectives. It also means that what content is fine, uncomfortable, or outright traumatic to each person can vary significantly. Sometimes people know in advance what content they'd like to tread carefully or avoid entirely. Other times, people don't realize something is deeply troubling to them until they encounter it at the table. Discuss the known content before your first game. Additionally, make sure anyone at the table is free to call for a moment or scene to stop if they realize it's troubling to them. If you do these two things, it will help to keep your table more safe and comfortable for everyone sitting at it.

## The Social Contract
A social contract is an informal agreement between people. In this case, it's made across the table that everyone's here to have fun, and we'll all do what we can to make sure that happens. With that, I'll present you two possible social contracts. Your group should either pick one, or make a third that they think fits better.

### Fantasy Fulfillment
Each person at the table shows up with some premade, polished, content. Players have characters with fleshed out personalities and voices, and likely backstories intended to tie into the game world and play out as a character arc in which they grow as characters. The keeper creates a setting and weaves these characters into a fleshed out plot involving developed non-player characters for the party to interact with in a dramatic capacity. The mechanics and rules can change to suit the fantasy of each player, which will generally involve some element of homebrew content being written to accomodate their character concepts. There is a certain structure to these campaigns that intends to lead the party in a certain direction to progress from beginning, middle, to end. Combat is "balanced", which often means "the party is unlikely to die", allowing players space to act out the fantasy of their character and character arc as they progress between level-appropriate content modules. Very dramatic moments may include a "deadly" encounter where life and death are at stake, during which player characters may die in a dramatically satisfying way. Character death can often be reversed through resurrection, as dieing is a mistake of the keeper in balancing or just an accident of bad dice when it is not planned with the consent of the player.

### Simulation
The keeper considers the player's requests for content, then creates a world with consistent mechanics. Players show up to the table and discover their characters, creating backstories and personalities in a collaborative environment within existing mechanics. While players may have ambitions for their characters, the onus is on each player to realize their goals within the mechanics of the world. The keeper prepares any content knowing that players are free to do whatever is in their character's power. The keeper respects that the player has no obligation to follow any progression along a story, and is free to carve their own path out of the world the keeper has produced. Players know that their freedom comes at the cost of consequences. One wrong step or fumbled die roll can end a player character's life permanently, and the responsibility for the character's safety falls firmly on the player. The life-or-death nature of the world creates dramatic tension by transforming any random moment into a potential struggle for survival. In response to this danger, players weave stories of their character's heroic victories and defeats against overwhelming odds. Players also engage in system mastery and thinking outside the box, learning to solve problems more flexibly to avoid the specter of death for as long as possible.

## Etiquette 
You're probably a player reading this. There are a few ways to drive your table crazy, and I'll list some behaviors that help avoid these.

### Don't argue rules at the table
A keeper is juggling many tasks at once at the table. Sometimes their encyclopedic knowledge of the rules may falter. Now's your time to say "wait, doesn't it work like this?" If your keeper says "naw, it works like I said" or "let's do **this** right now, we can revisit later", then they likely still have enough time to get back on their train of thought and continue juggling things like pacing, dramatic tension, etc, etc. If you instead press and create an argument, the game now stops. Players will now start checking their phones, pulled out of the fantasy while you and the keeper hold legal precedings. When the legal precedings are adjorned and the table is ready to continue playing the game, the table must now rebuild any momentum they had before. If it's once in a blue moon, or during relaxed moments, no harm, no foul. If this is frequent enough, however, it can be extremely frustrating to pause gameplay to argue over what will likely seem to be minutia. To dodge this, just note your argument and bring it up outside the session, or during a break, or some other time when there's no momentum to lose.

### Take timely turns
Initiative is rolled, the fight starts, and you watch others beginning to take their turn. Now's the time to ask "what do I do?" in your head. Consolidate it well enough, and you can quickly do your part in combat in under 30 seconds, keeping the game moving. Having a hard time remembering what options you have in combat? Draw some boxes on a blank sheet of paper. Put each of your abilities/tactics/actions in a box and draw an icon on it. If you can boil your decision down to a confident "I do X!", then you'll have plenty of space to add flowery description while keeping your turn under 30 seconds.

### Share the spotlight
This one's easy. Want to flesh out your character by roleplaying? Involve another player character in your moment. Who do you pick? The player who hasn't gotten a chance to say anything in 10 minutes. When everyone gets a turn playing, that's gameplay. Otherwise, it's one or two people playing while everyone else watches. You enter a room with a big red button in it. You could say "I run up and press it" and shine as being chaotic. Alternatively, you could say "Oh gosh, guys, I wanna press it so badly!" and give others space to interact with your decision. Maybe they hold you back while you comically scream "Nooooo! Let me press it! We may never see another as big and red!", or maybe you start a discussion of whether you should press the big red button. Either way, by involving others, you are making your fun roleplay moment into everyone's fun roleplay moment.

### Play up defeat
Your character starts with 1HP or has failed two death saving throws. Maybe they meet some horrible fate in a spike trap. Now's the time to ham it up. Work your dramatic muscles and get creative. You could play it straight with a "Just as I feel myself beginning to slip, I mouth the words 'so long, friends'." and see how many tears you can jerk from the party. Or, maybe this is a good moment for comedy. "I fall. 'Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Wow, how far down does this-' Thump." There's a lot of ways you can do this. Get creative.

# Creating your character
This handbook provides a skeletal set of character creation options, and are not intended for use in normal campaigns. Work with your keeper to determine what supplemental books you will use when creating your characters.

### What are abilities?
When you attempt to perform a task that involves natural ability or skill, your abilities help determine the odds of success. Here’s a breakdown of what different abilities govern.

#### Strength
Lift, climb, carry, grapple, throw, punch, and perform tasks that require brute force.
The total ammount one can carry is 6 times their strength score, minimum 18lb, maximum 120lb.

#### Dexterity
Sprint, jump, duck, dodge, sneak, and perform acrobatic maneuvers.

#### Constitution
Resist the effects of poison, toxins, fatigue, and illness. Determines your maximum hit points.

#### Intelligence
Process, calculate, and reason through complex information. 

#### Wisdom
Intuit, deduce, and read between the lines. Particularly good for resisting mind-altering magic, reading the intentions of others, and perceiving the world around you.

#### Charisma
Joke, flatter, persuade, lie, bluff, perform, and intimidate others. Useful wherever talking or looking good is needed.

### What are ability scores?
An ability score is a number ranging from 1 to 20 which quantifies your ability’s potency. When making an ability check, you roll a 1d20 and add the ability’s modifier. To calculate the ability modifier, take half the distance from 10, rounded down. Here’s a chart.

```
+-------+----------+
| Score | Modifier |
+-------+----------+
| 20    | +5       |
| 18-19 | +4       |
| 16-17 | +3       |
| 14-15 | +2       |
| 12-13 | +1       |
| 10-11 | 0        |
| 8-9   | -1       |
| 6-7   | -2       |
| 4-5   | -3       |
| 2-3   | -4       |
| 1     | -5       |
+-------+----------+
```

### Generating ability scores

#### Predetermined arrays
If you do not want to trust your fate to the dice, you may use an array of predetermined values. Values are not provided in order, and can be assigned arbitrarily. Work with your DM to determine which of these will work for your campaign, if any.
Standard array: [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]
Min-max array: [17, 14, 13, 10, 9, 7]
Commoner array: [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
Demigod array: [18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18]

#### Roll scores
If you trust your fate to the dice gods, this is your ritual. You will discover your character, for better or worse. Roll 4d6. Set aside the lowest roll and ignore it. Add up the remaining three. This is your strength score. Repeat this process for the other five abilities. When you’re done, you may switch the scores of two abilities. You may do this only for one pair of abilities.

## Skills
Every character has a proficiency bonus which increases with level progression. This proficiency bonus is added to checks made that utilize said skill.

### Specific Skills
Specific skills define a very narrow action, like agriculture, tracking, or poetry. They are not defined exhaustively, and can be added by supplementary books.

### General Skills
Some skills are general in nature, and may apply to a wide variety of situations. When a feat, culture, or class grants you proficiency in a skill, it will likely be in general skills. They are listed explicitly below. Each may be mapped to a specific ability, depending on how the skill is used.
- Acrobatics - Acts of agility such as performing a backflip or landing from a great height.
- Animal Handling - Befriending, calming, or commanding animals.
- Arcana - Recalling knowledge related to subjects of a magical nature.
- Athletics - Acts of controlled strength such as climbing, wrestling, or wrestling something from a creature's hand.
- Deception - Leading others to arrive at counterfactual conclusions.
- History - Recalling facts about past events, especially common sense and obscure trivia.
- Insight - Detecting deception in others.
- Intimidation - Motivating through fear.
- Investigation - Finding patterns or searching through complex information such as a drawer full of items, clues at a murder scene, or a particular book in a library.
- Medicine - Knowing of illnesses, their remedies, and experience administering them successfully.
- Nature - Knowing of the diversity nature and it's workings.
- Perception - Making out figures in the distance, what people are saying a room over, and the distinctly nutty flavor of cyanide.
- Performance - Miming, acting, singing, or dancing. Any act which aims not to deceive, but to inspire awe or interest.
- Persuasion - Motivation through convincing factual statements.
- Religion - Knowledge of deities, holy and unholy traditions, and the lore of fiends and celestials.
- Sleight of Hand - Agility of your hands to perform tricks, pickpocket, and otherwise use exceptionally fine motor skills.
- Stealth - Knowing how to not be seen.
- Survival - Learning to track, hunt, skin, tan, slaughter, trap, locate clean water, and navigate using the stars.

## Class
Your class decides your stamina dice, class features, and informs the role you'll play in your party. Talk to you keeper about what classes are available at your table.

### Commoner Stat Block
If you wish to only use the core rules, you may use this commoner stat block in lieu of supplemental character creation options.
```
#####################
# Name: 
# Class: Commoner
# HP(Max 5): 5
# AC: 10, Speed: 30ft
# Stamina Dice(Max 1d4): 1
# Ability scores: All are 10 (+0)
#-------------------
# Inventory:
# - Common clothes
# - One tool, left over from your previous profession
# - 5GP, your entire life savings
#####################
```
# Roleplaying

## Control your character
As a player, you have the freedom to breathe life into your character. For example, let's take a player Geremy and his character Alexa, a human commoner. 
The keeper prompts Geremy "A large toad rises from the surface of the pond water and stares at you. It ribbits out a greeting. What do you do?"

### Describe
If Geremy is just getting started or uncomfortable with acting, he might respond like this.
"Alexa thinks the toad is repulsive and screams and backs up."
This is a completely valid way to play.

### Act
If Geremy feels comfortable acting out his character's speech and actions, he can respond this.
"'Oh gods, look at the warts and mucus! I think I might be sick.' With that, Alexa backs up."
Perhaps Geremy will show a look of disgust and pretend to take a step back or cover his mouth.

## Initiative
In combat, combatants take turns. The combat order is known as initiative. 

### Standard
In standard initiative, each combatant rolls a 1d20 and adds their dexterity modifier to the roll. Turn order reflects the roll. On a tie, 
the combatant with the highest dexterity goes first. When a tie remains after comparing dexterity, combatants each roll a 1d20 and the highest
goes first. Combat with this initiative is consistent between rounds, and so players can count on turn order when making plans.

### (Variant)Team initiative
Each team chooses one representative, who rolls a 1d20 and adds their proficiency modifier to the roll. The combatants on the team with
the highest roll take their turns for that round simultaneously. When the first team finishes, the second team takes their turns
simultaneously. After both teams have taken their turns, each team selects a representative to roll initiative for the next round. This
variant is useful for cutting down on book-keeping while introducing randomness each round. Players cannot necessarily count on turn
order, as an enemy team may go twice in a row.

### (Variant)Simultaneous initiative
Each round, every player character chooses what they will attempt to do (eg cast a spell, attack a specific enemy, retreat and hide).
All player rolls are made simultaneously. The keeper then goes in an arbitrary order (likely left to right across a battle map)
and calls for rolls in order to judge what happens. This prevents players from using knowledge of turn order, enemy, or friendly
actions at the time of making their decision for the round. In turn, this renders combat chaotic and unpredictable.

## On your turn
On each turn, you receive the following:
- 1 action
- 1 bonus action
- 1 free object interaction
- 1 reaction
- Movement equal to your movement speed

### Actions in combat
There is an assortment of actions you may use in combat.

- Attack: You may make an melee or ranged attack. You may also attempt to grapple or shove a creature, which requires a contested athletics check made against either an athletics or acrobatics check(their choice).
- Cast A Spell: You may cast a spell which as a casting time of one action.
- Dash: You gain movement equal to your current movement. For example, if you had 30ft of movement, you would gain 30ft by dashing.
- Disengage: Normally, an enemy may take an attack of opportunity when you leave their melee range. Disengaging prevents this.
- Dodge: Attack rolls made against you are made with disadvantage if you can see the attacker. Dexterity saving throws are made with advantage.
- Help: You can aid another creature in completing a task, giving them advantage with it. Or, you may distract an enemy you are within 5ft of, giving the first attack made against them advantage.
- Hide: Provided you have entered a space that is obscured from sight, you may hide. The keeper will likely ask for a stealth check made against passive nearby creature's perception.
- Ready: You declare an action(and potentially movement) that you will use under a certain condition(such as if a creature turns hostile). If that condition is met, your readied action is triggered. If you prepare to cast a spell, it uses any relevant resources as if you had actually cast the spell, regardless of whether it was triggered.
- Search: You seek to find something. Your keeper will likely request an investigation or perception check.

#### How to make attack rolls
Roll a 1d20. If you're proficient with the weapon, add your proficiency bonus. Then, add the relevant ability modifier. As a general rule, melee and thrown attacks use strength, while ranged attacks use dexterity. A roll that meets or beats the AC of the target is a hit. If your d20 roll is 20, you have rolled a natural 20 and automatically hit. If your d20 roll is a 1, you roll a natural 1 and automatically miss.

#### How to make damage rolls
Once you've hit, check your weapon's damage for that attack. Roll all dice used for that damage, then add the same ability modifier that you used when making the attack roll. If you rolled a nat 20 on the attack role, you deal critical damage. When rolling critical damage, all dice are doubled. For example, an attack that would deal 1d8+3 damage now deals 2d8+3 damage.  


### Bonus actions
Some spells and special abilities consume bonus actions instead of regular actions. Actions and bonus actions are not interchangeable.

### Free object interactions
Some actions such as storing or retrieving an object from your inventory, opening a door, speaking a six second message, or picking up an object
from the ground.

### Reactions
Some spells can be cast using a reaction when some trigger (such as being attacked or falling) takes place. In addition, you may expend a
reaction to perform a melee attack against an enemy who is moving out of engagement range.

### Movement
Combat is centered around 5ft increments of distance. You may move in these increments. Once you have moved your maximum movement speed
in one turn, you cannot move again until the start of your next turn. Moving 5ft counts against all your movement speeds. This means
if you have 30ft movement and 15 flying, you may fly 15ft and walk 15ft, but you cannot walk 30ft and then fly 15ft.

#### Jumping
Jumping from more than 5ft requires 10ft of movement. When making a high jump, your body raises an amount of feet equal to your strength modifier.
When long jumping with a running start, you move an amount of feet equal to your strenghth modifier and proficiency bonus.

#### Difficult terrain
Difficult terrain requires you to move more slowly. This means that for every 5ft of distance covered in difficult terrain, you must exert 10ft of movement.
Examples of difficult terrain:
- Knee-deep mud
- slippery ice
- climbing up or down without a climbing speed (which will likely also require an acrobatics or athletics check)
- Swimming without a swimming speed
- sand

#### Healer's Kit
A kit filled with gauze, scissors, bandages, salves, and other medicinal gear.
Has 10 charges.
When you use this kit on yourself or another creature, make a medicine check
to determine the outcome.

```
+--------------+----------------------------+
|     Roll     |          Outcome           |
+--------------+----------------------------+
| 1 or less    | Takes 1d4 piercing damage. |
| 2-5          | No effect.                 |
| 6-10         | Stabilized if not already. |
| 11-15        | Heals 1d4 hit points.      |
| 16-20        | Heal 1d6 hit points.       |
| 21 or higher | Heal 1d8 hit points.       |
+--------------+----------------------------+
```

#### Flask of oil
A flask of oil can be thrown to create a 5ft puddle or soak an enemy. If lit,
an oil-soaked creature takes 1d8+2 fire damage. A creature that starts it's turn
in or enters a fire makes a DC 14 DEX save to avoid 1d6 fire damage.

#### Potion of Healing
A flask of pink liquid which heals 2d4+2 hit points when consumed.

#### Caltrops
You may drop caltrops over a space of four 5ft squares that are connected. When
you do, any creature who enters that space must make a DC 14 dex save. On a
failure, the creature receives 1 piercing damage and their movement is reduced
to 0. A creature who moves carefully treats the square as difficult terrain and
rolls normally. A creature who moves normally rolls with disadvantage.

```

#### Weapon properties

##### Ammunition
Weapons with the ammunition property require ammunition to make ranged attacks. Each attack expends one piece of
ammunication. Retrieving the ammunition is part of the attack. You can recover half your expended ammunication
by spending one minute to search the battlefield. When you use a weapon with the ammunition property to make a melee attack, it's treated
as an improvised weapon.

##### Finesse
Attacks with this weapon can use your choice of strength or dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls, and
both rolls must use the same modifier.

##### Heavy
Small creatures receive disadvantage on Attack rolls with heavy weapons.

##### Light
When you make an attack with a light weapon in one hand, you may use your bonus action to make an attack using
a light weapon in another hand. This attack's damage does not benefit from your ability modifier.

##### Loading
Each time you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to make an attack with a weapon posessing the loading
property, you can only fire once, regardless of how many attacks you have.

##### Range
A ranged weapon has a range specified in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The first number in
the range is the normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon's long range. Attacking beyond normal range confers
disadvantage on the attack roll. You cannot make attacks beyond the long range.

##### Reach
This weapon gains an additional 5 feet of range when attacking, as well as determining reach for opportunity attacks.

##### Special
This weapon has unique properties delivered by name in the special weapons section below.

##### Thrown
You can throw thrown weapons to make a ranged Attack. You use the same modifier for the thrown attack
as you would make for the melee attack.

##### Two-handed
This weapon requirees both hands to make attacks.

##### Versatile
This weapon can be used with one hand, or with two hands. The two-handed damage value appears in parentheses after the property.

##### Improvised Weapons
At the keeper's discretion, a an improvised weapon may be used to inflict more damage than an unarmed attack.
If it resembles a weapon, such as a club, it may be used as such with the same damage, proficiency, and ability modifier.
If it doesn't resemble a weapon, it deals at most 1d4 damage, has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

##### Silvered Weapons
One silvered weapon or ten pieces of silvered ammunition generally costs 100gp. They perform identically to their normal counterparts,
with the exception that some enemies are weak to silver.

##### Special Weapons
Lance: Attacks within 5 feet have disadvantage. The weapon requires two hands when you're not mounted.

Net: Creatures large or smaller are restrained when hit by a net until freed. Breaking out requires a DC 11 strength check.
Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroyes the net, ending the restrained effect. When you use an action,
bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of how many attacks you otherwise have.

```
### Water
An adventurer needs to drink at least one gallon of water each day, or lose one
stamina die. If they have a water container, they may use it throughout the day, 
refilling it at water sources, if any can be found nearby. In extremely hot or 
dry terrain, an adventurer instead needs to drink two gallons.

### Food
An adventure needs to eat at least one pound of food each day, or lose one
stamina die.

### Sleep
An adventurer must sleep at least 6 hours each day. Failing this, they lose one
stamina die each time each morning without sleep. One may not sleep in
armor.

### Stamina
An adventurer has stamina dice to measure their state of physical endurance.
They may not expend a stamina die if they have none left. If an adventurer loses
a stamina die when they have none left, they must succeed a DC 15 constitution
save to avoid falling unconscious for 1d4 hours. If you lose stamina dice when
unconscious in this way, roll the die and subtract it from your hit points. If
your hit points run out this way, you die.

### Clothing
If exposed to the elements in an extremely hot or cold environment, an adventurer must succeed a DC 14 constitution saving
throw or lose a stamina die. This check repeats for each hour spent exposed to the elements. An adventurer may avoid
these checks by staying in shelter or wearing clothing appropriate to the weather.

### Rest
An adventurer may wish to rest to recover their physical and mental stamina as 
well as perform maintenance of their gear. A rest takes 8 hours, and can occur
once per day. Provided an adventurer is not suffering from starvation, exposure
to harsh elements(such as ice or desert sun), or dehydration, they may regain 
one stamina die for each amenity that their rest includes(See amenities table
below). Adventurers may also expend up to one stamina die for each amenity 
during the rest. An adventurer may expend a stamina die to roll it, add their
constitution bonus, and restore that many hit points.
```

### Conditions

#### Down
A creature is downed when their hit points fall below 1. A downed creature is
paralyzed, knocked prone, and incoming attacks deal critical damage. At the
start of a downed creature's turn, it must expend a stamina die to make a death
saving throw, or else immediately die. The expended stamina die is added to the
creature's hit points, and the down condition is removed if the creature's hit

## Magic

### Spells

#### Level
Spells range in level from cantrip (0) to legendary (6). This indicates not only how powerful they are, but also how much magical
energy is required to cast a given spell. Most classes will have their own resource spent by casting spells. If you hold an action
to cast a spell, any resources for that spell are consumed regardless of whether they 

#### Range
Some spells have a maximum range they can be cast from, like 120 feet. Others require physical touch, denoted by range: touch.
Spells with range: self can only be cast on the caster.

#### Casting time
Casting time is how long it takes to cast a spell.

#### Duration
Decides how long a spell's effects will last. A spell with instantaneous duration ends immediately.

#### Concentration
When a spell has concentration, it means that the duration can be cut short if the caster takes damage and fails
a concentration saving throw whose DC is 10 or half the damage received, whichever is higher. You also lose concentration
when unconscious, incapacitated, or dead.

#### Areas of effect

##### Cone
A cone's as long as it is wide. This is to say that a 15ft cone is 15 feet long, and it's diameter at the base is 15ft.

##### Cube
A cube's sides are all the same, so a 5ft cube is 5ft by 5ft by 5ft.

##### Cylinder
A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle with a radius described by the spell. The circle's either on the ground
or at a height specified by the spell. A second circle directly above the first is the top of the cylinder, and anything between
the two is inside it.

##### Line
The line extends from it's point of originatn in a straight path up to it's length and covers an area defined its width, provided
in the spell.

##### Sphere
The sphere extends outward from a point a distance equal to it's radius. Anything a distance equal or less than the radius of the sphere
from it's center is inside it.

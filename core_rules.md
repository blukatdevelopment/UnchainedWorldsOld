# Foreword

### What is Unchained Worlds?
Unchained Worlds is a tabletop roleplaying game designed with the intention of providing a table of three to seven people with tools, rules, and content to participate in Unchained World's three pillars of exploration, combat, and roleplaying. Unchained Worlds differs from most competing games in that it is neither a clone of an existing game, nor is it designed as a commercial product. Unchained Worlds is both free as in free beer and free as in freedom. It’s content is deliberately modular and self-contained in order to make the process of selecting, using, and authoring content easy. 

### Why Unchained Worlds?
Unchained Worlds is built with “less is more” as its motto. Character customization options are slim, hit points are low for monsters and adventurers, and levels are capped at 10. This lends itself to low power play wherein a party of players must carefully consider the consequences for their actions and use lateral thinking to overcome obstacles and limitations. The worlds explored with this system are intended to be gritty and dangerous places where decision-making and roleplaying is more important than character build. While this system can be used for linear epic campaigns and for combat-focused power gaming, such play is not the primary concern.

### How do I play Unchained Worlds?
At your table, one person assumes the role of Game Master. They create the world that is explored, control non-player characters(henceforth NPC), and referee combat and player interaction with the world. All other people at the table are players, who each control a player character. Player characters (henceforth PCs) explore the world, interact with NPCs, and fight. There may be a linear campaign designed for the players to explore, or there may be a sandbox world that is explored according to the player’s interests.


# Creating your character
This handbook provides a skeletal set of character creation options, and are not intended for use in normal campaigns. Work with your game master to determine what supplemental books you will use when creating your characters.

### What are abilities?
When you attempt to perform a task that involves natural ability or skill, your abilities help determine the odds of success. Here’s a breakdown of what different abilities govern.

#### Strength
Lift, climb, carry, grapple, throw, punch, and perform tasks that require brute force.

#### Dexterity
Sprint, jump, duck, dodge, sneak, and perform acrobatic maneuvers.

#### Constitution
Resist the effects of poison, toxins, fatigue, and illness. Determines your maximum hit points.

#### Intelligence
Process, calculate, and reason through complex information. 

#### Wisdom
Intuit, deduce, and read between the lines. Particularly good for resisting mind-altering magic, reading the intentions of others, and perceiving the world around you.

#### Charisma
Joke, flatter, persuade, lie, bluff, perform, and intimidate others. Useful wherever talking or looking good is needed.

### What are ability scores?
An ability score is a number ranging from 1 to 20 which quantifies your ability’s potency. When making an ability check, you roll a 1d20 and add the ability’s modifier. To calculate the ability modifier, take half the distance from 10, rounded down. Here’s a chart.

```
+-------+----------+
| Score | Modifier |
+-------+----------+
| 20    | +5       |
| 18-19 | +4       |
| 16-17 | +3       |
| 14-15 | +2       |
| 12-13 | +1       |
| 10-11 | 0        |
| 8-9   | -1       |
| 6-7   | -2       |
| 4-5   | -3       |
| 2-3   | -4       |
| 1     | -5       |
+-------+----------+
```

### Generating ability scores

#### Predetermined arrays
If you do not want to trust your fate to the dice, you may use an array of predetermined values. Values are not provided in order, and can be assigned arbitrarily. Work with your DM to determine which of these will work for your campaign, if any.
Standard array: [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]
Min-max array: [17, 14, 13, 10, 9, 7]
Commoner array: [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
Demigod array: [18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18]

#### Roll scores
If you trust your fate to the dice gods, this is your ritual. You will discover your character, for better or worse. Roll 4d6. Set aside the lowest roll and ignore it. Add up the remaining three. This is your strength score. Repeat this process for the other five abilities. When you’re done, you may switch the scores of two abilities. You may do this only for one pair of abilities.

## Skills
Every character has a proficiency bonus which increases with level progression. This proficiency bonus is added to checks made that utilize said skill.

### Specific Skills
Specific skills define a very narrow action, like agriculture, tracking, or poetry. They are not defined exhaustively, and can be added by supplementary books.

### General Skills
Some skills are general in nature, and may apply to a wide variety of situations. When a feat, lineage, or class grants you proficiency in a skill, it will likely be in general skills. They are listed explicitly below.
- Acrobatics - Acts of agility such as performing a backflip or landing from a great height.
- Animal Handling - Befriending, calming, or commanding animals.
- Arcana - Recalling knowledge related to subjects of a magical nature.
- Athletics - Acts of controlled strength such as climbing, wrestling, or wrestling something from a creature's hand.
- Deception - Leading others to arrive at counterfactual conclusions.
- History - Recalling facts about past events, especially common sense and obscure trivia.
- Insight - Detecting deception in others.
- Intimidation - Motivating through fear.
- Investigation - Finding patterns or searching through complex information such as a drawer full of items, clues at a murder scene, or a particular book in a library.
- Medicine - Knowing of illnesses, their remedies, and experience administering them successfully.
- Nature - Knowing of the diversity nature and it's workings.
- Perception - Making out figures in the distance, what people are saying a room over, and the distinctly nutty flavor of cyanide.
- Performance - Miming, acting, singing, or dancing. Any act which aims not to deceive, but to inspire awe or interest.
- Persuasion - Motivation through convincing factual statements.
- Religion - Knowledge of deities, holy and unholy traditions, and the lore of fiends and celestials.
- Sleight of Hand - Agility of your hands to perform tricks, pickpocket, and otherwise use exceptionally fine motor skills.
- Stealth - Knowing how to not be seen.
- Survival - Learning to track, hunt, skin, tan, slaughter, trap, locate clean water, and navigate using the stars.

## Lineage
Your lineage describes both the physical traits and cultural traditions handed down to you by your ancestors. Naturally, these details are mutable. That said, here’s the unskilled human. Additional lineages can be found in supplemental books.

### Human
**Languages:** Common
**Size:** Medium
**Speed:** 30 feet
**Ability Score Increase:** +1 to each ability score

Choose one of the following features:
- **Actor:** You have advantage on charisma checks made when trying to act as a different person. If you have heard a creature speak or make a sound for at least one minute, you may now speak like them or mimic the sound. Other creatures can contest (insight vs deception) this speech or sound to determine it’s fake.
- **Charger:** You can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or shove a creature when you use your action to dash. If you have just moved at least 10 feet in a straight line, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack’s damage roll or push the target up to 10 feet away from you if you successfully shove the target.
- **Crossbow Expert:** You can ignore the loading quality of crossbows, provided you are proficient with them. You no longer have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls as a result of being within 5 feet of a hostile creature. You may use a bonus action to attack with a hand crossbow after using your action to attack with a one-handed weapon.
- **Linguist:** You learn three languages of your choice.
- **Mobile:** Your base speed increases by ten feet. When you dash, difficult terrain doesn’t cost extra movement on that turn. After you make a melee attack against a creature, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn regardless of whether you hit.
- **Alert:** Your initiative rolls gain a +5 bonus, you cannot be surprised while conscious, and other creatures don’t gain advantage on attack rolls made against you as a result of being unseen by you.
- **Magic initiate:** You learn the prestidigitation cantrip. After you cast it using this ability, you must complete a full rest in order to cast it again with this ability.

## Background
Your background describes the life you had before you began adventuring. It decides your societal status, skills, and general level of wealth. A brief backstory which describes the following elements works well:
1. How did this background shape your character?
2. Why did your character leave their background?
3. What relationships, if any, does your character have with the other player characters.
The one background provided is the farmer.

### Farmer
You bent your back under a blazing sun to till the land and raise a crop.
**Skills:** agriculture, proficiency with sickles
**Items:** Common clothes, a sickle, a chicken, a 30lb sack of wheat berries, and a pouch containing 5 silver pieces

## Class
Your class decides your hit dice, class features, and informs the role you'll play in your party.
The commoner class is provided below, which is intended only for level 0 characters such as those used in character creation funnels.

### Commoner
You are average, bland, and unremarkable. You don't wield magic, and you aren't great with swords.
And yet, here you are.

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** None
**Weapons:** Club, dagger
**Saving throws**: Constitution

#### Skills
Choose 2 from the following: Athletics, Insight, History, Nature, Religion

#### Starting Equipment
- club
- either a. 5 torches or b. waterskin
```

+-------+----------+-------------------+------------+-------------------+
| Level | Hit Dice | Proficiency Bonus | Minimum XP |       Feats       |
+-------+----------+-------------------+------------+-------------------+
|     0 | 1d4      | +1                |          0 |                   |
|     1 | 1d4      | +2                |        200 | Training Montage  |
+-------+----------+-------------------+------------+-------------------+
```

#### Training Montage
You have survived long enough as a commoner. Remove all your class features
and hit dice (this resets your max HP to 0). Retain any proficiencies and
equipment. You lose all levels in commoner. Choose a class other than commoner.
You are now level 1 in the chosen class.

# Roleplaying

## Control your character
As a player, you have the freedom to breathe life into your character. For example, let's take a player Geremy and his character Alexa, a human commoner. 
The GM prompts Geremy "A large toad rises from the surface of the pond water and stares at you. It ribbits out a greeting. What do you do?"

### Describe
If Geremy is just getting started or uncomfortable with acting, he might respond like this.
"Alexa thinks the toad is repulsive and screams and backs up."
This is a completely valid way to play.

### Act
If Geremy feels comfortable acting out his character's speech and actions, he can respond this.
"'Oh gods, look at the warts and mucus! I think I might be sick.' With that, Alexa backs up."
Perhaps Geremy will show a look of disgust and pretend to take a step back or cover his mouth.

## Initiative
In combat, combatants take turns. The combat order is known as initiative. 

### Standard
In standard initiative, each combatant rolls a 1d20 and adds their dexterity modifier to the roll. Turn order reflects the roll. On a tie, 
the combatant with the highest dexterity goes first. When a tie remains after comparing dexterity, combatants each roll a 1d20 and the highest
goes first. Combat with this initiative is consistent between rounds, and so players can count on turn order when making plans.

### (Variant)Team initiative
Each team chooses one representative, who rolls a 1d20 and adds their proficiency modifier to the roll. The combatants on the team with
the highest roll take their turns for that round simultaneously. When the first team finishes, the second team takes their turns
simultaneously. After both teams have taken their turns, each team selects a representative to roll initiative for the next round. This
variant is useful for cutting down on book-keeping while introducing randomness each round. Players cannot necessarily count on turn
order, as an enemy team may go twice in a row.

### (Variant)Simultaneous initiative
Each round, every player character chooses what they will attempt to do (eg cast a spell, attack a specific enemy, retreat and hide).
All player rolls are made simultaneously. The game master then goes in an arbitrary order (likely left to right across a battle map)
and calls for rolls in order to judge what happens. This prevents players from using knowledge of turn order, enemy, or friendly
actions at the time of making their decision for the round. In turn, this renders combat chaotic and unpredictable.

## On your turn
On each turn, you receive the following:
- 1 action
- 1 bonus action
- 1 free object interaction
- 1 reaction
- Movement equal to your movement speed

### Actions in combat
There is an assortment of actions you may use in combat.

- Attack: You may make an melee or ranged attack. You may also attempt to grapple or shove a creature, which requires a contested athletics check made against either an athletics or acrobatics check(their choice).
- Cast A Spell: You may cast a spell which as a casting time of one action.
- Dash: You gain movement equal to your current movement. For example, if you had 30ft of movement, you would gain 30ft by dashing.
- Disengage: Normally, an enemy may take an attack of opportunity when you leave their melee range. Disengaging prevents this.
- Dodge: Attack rolls made against you are made with disadvantage if you can see the attacker. Dexterity saving throws are made with advantage.
- Help: You can aid another creature in completing a task, giving them advantage with it. Or, you may distract an enemy you are within 5ft of, giving the first attack made against them advantage.
- Hide: Provided you have entered a space that is obscured from sight, you may hide. The GM will likely ask for a stealth check made against passive nearby creature's perception.
- Ready: You declare an action(and potentially movement) that you will use under a certain condition(such as if a creature turns hostile). If that condition is met, your readied action is triggered. If you prepare to cast a spell, it uses any relevant resources as if you had actually cast the spell, regardless of whether it was triggered.
- Search: You seek to find something. Your GM will likely request an investigation or perception check.

#### How to make attack rolls
Roll a 1d20. If you're proficient with the weapon, add your proficiency bonus. Then, add the relevant ability modifier. As a general rule, melee and thrown attacks use strength, while ranged attacks use dexterity. A roll that meets or beats the AC of the target is a hit. If your d20 roll is 20, you have rolled a natural 20 and automatically hit. If your d20 roll is a 1, you roll a natural 1 and automatically miss.

#### How to make damage rolls
Once you've hit, check your weapon's damage for that attack. Roll all dice used for that damage, then add the same ability modifier that you used when making the attack roll. If you rolled a nat 20 on the attack role, you deal critical damage. When rolling critical damage, all dice are doubled. For example, an attack that would deal 1d8+3 damage now deals 2d8+3 damage.  


### Bonus actions
Some spells and special abilities consume bonus actions instead of regular actions. Actions and bonus actions are not interchangeable.

### Free object interactions
Some actions such as storing or retrieving an object from your inventory, opening a door, speaking a six second message, or picking up an object
from the ground.

### Reactions
Some spells can be cast using a reaction when some trigger (such as being attacked or falling) takes place. In addition, you may expend a
reaction to perform a melee attack against an enemy who is moving out of engagement range.

### Movement
Combat is centered around 5ft increments of distance. You may move in these increments. Once you have moved your maximum movement speed
in one turn, you cannot move again until the start of your next turn. Moving 5ft counts against all your movement speeds. This means
if you have 30ft movement and 15 flying, you may fly 15ft and walk 15ft, but you cannot walk 30ft and then fly 15ft.

#### Jumping
Jumping from more than 5ft requires 10ft of movement. When making a high jump, your body raises an amount of feet equal to your strength modifier.
When long jumping with a running start, you move an amount of feet equal to your strenghth modifier and proficiency bonus.

#### Difficult terrain
Difficult terrain requires you to move more slowly. This means that for every 5ft of distance covered in difficult terrain, you must exert 10ft of movement.
Examples of difficult terrain:
- Knee-deep mud
- slippery ice
- climbing up or down without a climbing speed (which will likely also require an acrobatics or athletics check)
- Swimming without a swimming speed
- sand

#### Weapon properties

##### Ammunition
Weapons with the ammunition property require ammunition to make ranged attacks. Each attack expends one piece of
ammunication. Retrieving the ammunition is part of the attack. You can recover half your expended ammunication
by spending one minute to search the battlefield. When you use a weapon with the ammunition property to make a melee attack, it's treated
as an improvised weapon.

##### Finesse
Attacks with this weapon can use your choice of strength or dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls, and
both rolls must use the same modifier.

##### Heavy
Small creatures receive disadvantage on Attack rolls with heavy weapons.

##### Light
When you make an attack with a light weapon in one hand, you may use your bonus action to make an attack using
a light weapon in another hand. This attack does not benefit from your proficiency bonus.

##### Loading
Each time you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to make an attack with a weapon posessing the loading
property, you can only fire once, regardless of how many attacks you have.

##### Range
A ranged weapon has a range specified in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The first number in
the range is the normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon's long range. Attacking beyond normal range confers
disadvantage on the attack roll. You cannot make attacks beyond the long range.

##### Reach
This weapon gains an additional 5 feet of range when attacking, as well as determining reach for opportunity attacks.

##### Special
This weapon has unique properties delivered by name in the special weapons section below.

##### Thrown
You can throw thrown weapons to make a ranged Attack. You use the same modifier for the thrown attack
as you would make for the melee attack.

##### Two-handed
This weapon requirees both hands to make attacks.

##### Versatile
This weapon can be used with one hand, or with two hands. The two-handed damage value appears in parentheses after the property.

##### Improvised Weapons
At the GM's discretion, a an improvised weapon may be used to inflict more damage than an unarmed attack.
If it resembles a weapon, such as a club, it may be used as such with the same damage, proficiency, and ability modifier.
If it doesn't resemble a weapon, it deals at most 1d4 damage, has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

##### Silvered Weapons
One silvered weapon or ten pieces of silvered ammunition generally costs 100gp. They perform identically to their normal counterparts,
with the exception that some enemies are weak to silver.

##### Special Weapons
Lance: Attacks within 5 feet have disadvantage. The weapon requires two hands when you're not mounted.

Net: Creatures large or smaller are restrained when hit by a net until freed. Breaking out requires a DC 11 strength check.
Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroyes the net, ending the restrained effect. When you use an action,
bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of how many attacks you otherwise have.

```

#### Wretched
You beg, forage, or steal your meals when you eat, which isn't every night.
Security isn't something you're familiar with, nor is soap. Commoners avoid you
when they can. If your clothes aren't tattered and filthy, they must be
exceptionally new. You do not live so much as you survive.

#### Squalid
You make a living, but just barely. You likely have many roommates, or else live in
a shack outside of town. Gruel and water sustain you, but just barely. Occasionally
commoners might take pity on you and give you a crust of bread or candle, but you
cannot affort to eat at a table with them. Your life is precarious, and are you one
misfortune away from a wretched lifestyle.

#### Poor
You are a commoner. A skilled trade guarantees you not only a seat at the table
and greetings from strangers, but occasionally a meal with meat or cheese.
You likely have a small room to call your own, or otherwise to share with your entire family.

#### Modest
You're likely literate, and your trade uses your mind more than your body. Your clothing
is well maintained, and so is your hygeine. You are welcomed by most and tolerated by
nobles, so long as you are quiet and pay your tab. You eat well and your house is warm
and dry, if a bit small. A guard would take your word over anyone dressed lower than you.

#### Comfortable
Your skill is either rare, or in high demand. Maybe you own a modest business.
Whatever the case, people respect you. You can put a wedge of cheese, loaf of
bread, and bottle of wine on the table whenever you like. You likely maintain
a written correspondence with multiple pen pals, and have connections with 
people in higher places. You'll likely have a set of clothing, furniture,
plates, a house or other posessions which are passed on through your family name.

#### Wealthy
You are likely an employer of at least one servant and have a wide selection of
clothing, food, and entertainment to choose from. Your property is likely large
enough that you don't need to worry about rubbing elbows with commoners.
You have friends in high places, and guards will tend to believe you and your
bribe money over mere evidence. Those jealous peasants below you respect and
envy what they cannot achieve.

#### Aristocratic
When the silly merchants dressed in last month's fashion leave your manor,
you're free to truly relax in decadance. A small army of servants meets your every
whim. Unfortunately, harp music, private jesters, and fine art get boring. Sometimes
you need to treat yourself and order an exotic animal or lead an expedition. Oh, 
or maybe you could commission a giant statue of yourself riding a horse! Either way,
the guards at least keep the peasants off your land so you can hunt in peace.

### Water
An adventurer needs to drink at least one gallon of water each day, or gain one level of exhaustion.
If they have a water container, they may use it throughout the day, refilling it at water sources, if any can be found nearby.
In extremely hot or dry terrain, an adventurer instead needs to drink two gallons.

### Food
An adventure needs to eat at least one pound of food each day, or gain one level of exhaustion.

### Sleep
An adventurer must sleep at least 6 hours each day. Failing this, they gain one level of exhaustion each time they complete
a day without sleep.

### Clothing
If exposed to the elements in an extremely hot or cold environment, an adventurer must succeed a DC 14 constitution saving
throw or gain a level of exhaustion. This check repeats for each hour spent exposed to the elements. An adventurer may avoid
these checks by staying in shelter or wearing clothing appropriate to the weather.

## Magic

### Spells

#### Level
Spells range in level from cantrip (0) to legendary (6). This indicates not only how powerful they are, but also how much magical
energy is required to cast a given spell. Most classes will have their own resource spent by casting spells. If you hold an action
to cast a spell, any resources for that spell are consumed regardless of whether they 

#### Range
Some spells have a maximum range they can be cast from, like 120 feet. Others require physical touch, denoted by range: touch.
Spells with range: self can only be cast on the caster.

#### Casting time
Casting time is how long it takes to cast a spell.

#### Duration
Decides how long a spell's effects will last. A spell with instantaneous duration ends immediately.

#### Concentration
When a spell has concentration, it means that the duration can be cut short if the caster takes damage and fails
a concentration saving throw whose DC is 10 or half the damage received, whichever is higher. You also lose concentration
when unconscious, incapacitated, or dead.

#### Areas of effect

##### Cone
A cone's as long as it is wide. This is to say that a 15ft cone is 15 feet long, and it's diameter at the base is 15ft.

##### Cube
A cube's sides are all the same, so a 5ft cube is 5ft by 5ft by 5ft.

##### Cylinder
A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle with a radius described by the spell. The circle's either on the ground
or at a height specified by the spell. A second circle directly above the first is the top of the cylinder, and anything between
the two is inside it.

##### Line
The line extends from it's point of originatn in a straight path up to it's length and covers an area defined its width, provided
in the spell.

##### Sphere
The sphere extends outward from a point a distance equal to it's radius. Anything a distance equal or less than the radius of the sphere
from it's center is inside it.

### Spell List
This core rule book provides one spell, but others are provided by supplemental books.

```
This is a novice spell used by beginning spellcasters for practice. When you cast this spell, you create on of the 
following magical effects within range:

- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect.
- You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, torch, small camp fire, or equivalent fire.
- You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
- You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
- You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or surface for 1 hour.
- You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast the spell multiple times, up to three non-instantaneous effects can be active at once and can be dismissed each
effect using an action.

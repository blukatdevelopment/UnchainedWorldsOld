# Unchained Worlds

Welcome! Unchained worlds is an open-source tabletop roleplaying game.

## Why make a TTRPG?
Because I wanted to. More to point, because 5e had bloated player character options
that emphasized min-maxing and power-gaming and first edition clones carry over
design decisions that simply feel dated.

## Why not just use one of the existing systems? There has to be one that meets your needs.
You make a good point. But consider the following: I love FOSS. Why would I make a new system?
Well, because then I can share it and preserve the [four freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)

## Blukat, you silly banana! A TTRPG isn't software.
Sure it is. It just runs on human brains instead of computers. Git gud, scrub. :P

## Getting started (as a player)
You ready to start adventuring?
Grab a copy of the core rules book, then talk to your keeper about which content books to
look through for character creation options.

## Getting started (as a keeper)
Grab a copy of the core rules book, then figure out what content is suitable for your campaign.
Need a keeper's guide? Well, be patient! I still gotta write one.

## How to contribute?
First off, thanks for your interest. Many hands make light work.

### Modules
A module provides a few sessions of gameplay, accepting a group of adventurers
within a given level range. Multiple modules may be run back-to-back to provide
a party with a series of challenges, or a GM may geographically link the
settings of multiple modules to create a large and detailed world for a party
to explore freely.

[City of Southhorn](keeper_info/modules/city_of_southhorn/keeper_info.md) a party of
adventurers levels 1-3 enter the strife-filled city of Southhorn to uncover it's
mysteries and discover the dungeon beneath.

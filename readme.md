# Unchained Worlds

Welcome! Unchained worlds is an open-source tabletop roleplaying game.

## Why make a TTRPG?
Because I wanted to. More to point, because 5e had bloated player character options
that emphasized min-maxing and power-gaming and first edition clones carry over
design decisions that simply feel dated.

## Why not just use one of the existing systems? There has to be one that meets your needs.
You make a good point. But consider the following: I love FOSS. Why would I make a new system?
Well, because then I can share it and preserve the [four freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)

## Blukat, you silly banana! A TTRPG isn't software.
Sure it is. It just runs on human brains instead of computers. Git gud, scrub.

## Getting started (as a player)
You ready to start adventuring?
Grab a copy of the core rules book, then talk to your game master about which content books to
look through for lineage, class, and other stuff like spells or bonus mechanics.

## Getting started (as a game master)
Grab a copy of the core rules book, then figure out what content is suitable for your campaign.
Need a game master's guide? Well, be patient! I still gotta write one.

## GM links

### Rule supplements
[book of maladies](gm_info/book_of_maladies.md) contains some diseases, curses,
and a corruption table. 
[magic items](gm_info/magic_items.md) here's some magic items to stuff into your
dungeons.

### Campaigns
This is essentially campaign notes for a couple campaigns. These are not
polished, nor intended for running as-is, but may serve as inspiration for
others to borrow or steal from.

[Ironclad](gm_info/campaigns/Ironclad/gm_info.md) is a sandbox where adventurers
gather three legendary weapons from the island of Korrus.

[Lysteria](gm_info/campaigns/Lysteria/player_facing_rules.md) is a campaign
setting for running connected oneshots.

### Funnels
A character funnel gives each player multiple level 0 commoners, then puts the
group of followers through a gauntlet of deadly encounters. This serves a 
couple purposes:
- Give new players a mechanically simplified starting point
- Familiarize players with death in a non-traumatic way
- Create memorable moments to bond the party together before your proper adventure
- Provide each party member an emotionally resonant backstory

[Fear's Isle](gm_info/funnels/fears_isle/gm_info.md) A ship capsizes
unexpectedly, leaving the party seeking some way to escape the island they have
washed up on.

### Modules
A module provides a few sessions of gameplay, accepting a group of adventurers
within a given level range. Multiple modules may be run back-to-back to provide
a party with a series of challenges, or a GM may geographically link the
settings of multiple modules to create a large and detailed world for a party
to explore freely.

[City of Southhorn](gm_info/modules/city_of_southhorn/gm_info.md) a party of
adventurers levels 1-3 enter the strife-filled city of Southhorn to uncover it's
mysteries and discover the dungeon beneath.

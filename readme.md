# Unchained Worlds

Welcome! Unchained worlds is an open-source tabletop roleplaying game.

## Why make a TTRPG?
Because I wanted to. More to point, because 5e had bloated player character options
that emphasized min-maxing and power-gaming and first edition clones carry over
design decisions that simply feel dated.

## Why not just use one of the existing systems? There has to be one that meets your needs.
You make a good point. But consider the following: I love FOSS. Why would I make a new system?
Well, because then I can share it and preserve the [four freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)

## Blukat, you silly banana! A TTRPG isn't software.
Sure it is. It just runs on human brains instead of computers. Git gud, scrub. :P

A genre-flexible system powered by content packs.

Crunchy dungeon crawling system.

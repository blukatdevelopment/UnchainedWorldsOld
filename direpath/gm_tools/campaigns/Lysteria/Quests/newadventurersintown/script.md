# New Adventurers in town
A client named Sama is offering a 100GP contract for someone to recover an artifact. She's located in Flamevale in a tucked away club named Elegance, and will discuss the details in-person.

## The Road there
The party sets out. Everyone rolls a 1d20. On a nat 1, a giant rat appears on the road.

## Flamevale

The ruined city burns with the ghostly blue flames of a conflagration that once consumed it. Specters walk about the streets, seeming to hustle and bustle as they had presumably done before the flames. 

### City Streets
The party must navigate the city streets and find elegance.
Events:
- A guard puts up a wanted sign for "Diss Durlz", the Guulz Gang leader. He then starts interrogating the party. He'll ask the party if they're new in town, and if they know anything about Diss. If they ask, he'll offer directions to Elegance.
- A human man with black leather clothing beckons the party from a dark alley(Jeph the Moondust Dealer). He'll offer to sell the party some moon dust for 3GP.
- Spadetail(Duvra) is being bullied by members of the Guulz Gang. They're playing keep away with one of her shoes. Duvra's late for work, but will offer to give the party a round on her. She works at the Elegance.

### Elegance

The upstairs is an open warehouse, currently hosting a rave with a wizard performing a light show.

Stairs descend down into the Elegance, where there's a wolf folk man adorned with a beanie and dark spectacles on a dimly lit stage delivering slam poetry before a loose constellation of tables. When he delivers his final line, finger-snapping fills the smokey room.

There's a bar with spadetail workers, a man with a black leather outfit leaning against a wall(Jeph the Moondust Dealer), and a diverse group of patrons.

Sama is in the back. She has a map drawn up. She needs the Index, a notebook that can show the contents of any book within 60ft. She's offering 100GP for it.

"It's common knowledge among historians that the Library in flamevale was burned to the ground at the end of the Dwarven age. What most people don't know is that the human general that did it sacked the library first. I found a sales ledger for the Index, and the Moddlesber family bought it. I just need you to go get it from their manor. If you're quiet, I bet they won't even notice it's gone."

If escorted in by either the Jeph or the guard, they'll be greeted by the same, who will ask them about what they're doing. Jeph will disguise this as a sales pitch for drugs. The guard will instead offer to escort the party to the manor if it's mentioned, and will otherwise be suspicious.

### The Moddlesber manor

#### Dinner Party
There's a dinner party scheduled that day.
A list of attendees:
- Moddlesber family (father Gilbert, mother Laura, son Gilbert junior, daughter Raunda)
- Broadblade family of imperials (father Willworth, mother Julianna, son Billburt, daughter Sallyforth )
- Splitleaf family of high elves (father Fendhir, mother Sherha, son Golsa)
- Ironside family of bronzehammers(father Ghoramir, mother Fenda, son Dalgarn, son Tor, daughter Lara)
- Servants: Roger Wettleberg(M), Jack Muttenfinger(M), Tina Flutenbell(F), Rachel Butternut(F)

#### Guard Cordon
If the guard interrogates the party at the elegance, the manor will be surrounded by guards, who will begin negotiating with the Moddlesber to let them investigate.

```
Crown Guard
HP: 10(2d6+2)
AC: 14(leather, shield)

Attacks:
Spear +4, 1d6+2 piercing
```

#### Murder Mystery
If guards don't interrupt the dinner party, then Gilbert Moddlesber will be found dead in the washroom, bludgeoned with a candlestick. Sherha Splitleaf did it to hide her affair with him. Guards will be called to cordon off the house until the mystery is solved.

#### Thugs
If the guards are not present, the party will be confronted by Jeph and two of thugs who demand the party give up whatever they stole.

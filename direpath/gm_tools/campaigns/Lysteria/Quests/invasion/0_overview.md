# Invasion
This plot arc concerns the Duchess of Stagwich and her efforts to invade the
Northern region of Lysteria.

## Chapter 1: Magnussifant
Kill the king or retrieve dragon armor.

King Magnus of shadowtown has been exploiting the adventurers and is letting
his ego go to his head. When the party comes to shadowtown to get his briefing,
they'll find an illusion recorded from within a new safe bunker of his. The
party is hired to secure a site where mythical dragon armor is located. With the
dragon armor, he can become a god king and unite the North and defend against
the coming invasion. The location is crawling with forgelings that are
excavating the armor as he speaks. If the armor is not secured very soon, it
will be gone.


The captain of the guard tells the party that they fear the king has gone mad.
In his bunker, he's installing some kind of energy doors bought from Southern
scavengers. If the party acts now, they can storm his bunker and kill him before
those purple shields are operational.


## Chapter 2: Centerfire
Will the party stop a killer before they ruin the Northern alliance?

Flamevale's mayor has called for delegates from the region to convene and
discuss a mutual defense pact against the Southern invasion. Before the mayor
can give his speech of unity to the delegates, he is found dead in his room.
Someone attending the convention is responsible for the death.
The killer strikes again each hour, taking out a different delegate each time.
Delegates:
- Paseena from Bonespell (rabbitfolk warriors)
- Goblin king from Blackdrift (goblin warriors)
- Eugnach from Shadowtown (airship)
- Jonatan Muixí from Lostwind (Mage warriors)
- Sarva from Westmoor (Cultists)
- Rauni Järveläinen, mayor from Sandfrost (Chikimon) 
- Balbalar from Cursepeak (Florse cavalry)
- Sama representing Flamevale
- The Rat King of Ratville (giant Rat sabateurs)

## Chapter 3: Starcarver
Sword or blaster.

Sama or her sister informs the party about the location of a ruin in the Garland
Crater where an ancient disrupter sword is hidden. It's the only blade known to
cut through purple energy barriers. The party fights some alien-inspired
critters in this dungeon before getting the blade. Once the blade is recovered,
Sama asks to dissect the blade to decode it's inner workings.

If the party accepts this, the Starcarver will be destroyed, but she will learn
how to create a new magic item, the starcannon, for 500 gold each. The star
cannon produces a beam that lasts up to 1 minute and deals radiant damage each
turn. If a purple shield is hit for the full minute, the shield generator will
overload and explode.

## Chapter 4: Dragon Hunters
An elven man is sent by the dutchess of Stagwich to seduce Crasia in the
mountain by Blackdrift. The party is sent by Sama or her sister in order to
stop the elf and keep Crasia neutral. Optional objects involve killing Crasia,
or seducing crasia to join the Northern alliance.

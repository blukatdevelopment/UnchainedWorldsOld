# Magnussifent
Note: writing this name consistently is unnecessary.

Kill the king or retrieve dragon armor.

King Magnus of shadowtown has been exploiting the adventurers and is letting
his ego go to his head. When the party comes to shadowtown to get his briefing,
they'll find an illusion recorded from within a new safe bunker of his. The
party is hired to secure a site where mythical dragon armor is located. With the
dragon armor, he can become a god king and unite the North and defend against
the coming invasion. The location is crawling with forgelings that are
excavating the armor as he speaks. If the armor is not secured very soon, it
will be gone.


The captain of the guard tells the party that they fear the king has gone mad.
In his bunker, he's installing some kind of energy doors bought from Southern
scavengers. If the party acts now, they can storm his bunker and kill him before
those purple shields are operational.


## The Magnus Lair

Outside, the party will find an excavation team. They won't stop the party, but
will inform them that going in is extremely dangerous.

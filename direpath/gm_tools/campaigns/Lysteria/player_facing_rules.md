## Character creation rules

### Steps to create a commoner
1. Get a token/actor in Foundry
2. Roll abilities(4d6, drop lowest), swap up to one pair
3. Roll for background
4. Pick lineage
5. Apply commoner proficiencies/equipment

### Stats
For ability scores, roll 4d6 and drop the lowest. Abilities are rolled in order,
but one pair of abilities may be swapped before any bonuses are applied. Health
is rolled. If your character changes from commoner to another class, health is
re-rolled.

### Character Slots
Each player has three character slots. They may retire any character level 1 or
higher. If the player has an empty character slot, they can fill it with a new
commoner.

### Character advancement
Each player character starts as a level 0 commoner. (See: Core rules commoner
class) When you level up, you may pick a class. You keep all your skill
proficiencies, but reroll your hit points using the new class's hit die.

#### Table rule: Session-based XP
For this campaign, XP an every session will grant 1XP.
```
+-------+----+
| Level | XP |
+-------+----+
|     0 |  0 |
|     1 |  1 |
|     2 |  2 |

+-------+----+
```

## Sessions

### Board
The game master will put 1-2 items on a quest board.
These may be dungeons, jobs, or other activities that the guild members may be
interested in. Players may also add any plot hooks to this board to investigate
later.

### Plan
Players pick something they want to do that session. Based on this description,
the game master prepares any content needed for the session. The players and
game master then schedule a session.

### Play
The party makes any purchases and hires any hirelings. They then embark on their
adventure, traveling to the location. They leave and return to a guild hall.

### New Guild Hall
Adventurers may build a new guild hall in a city they've visited. Doing so
allows them to start from that new hall, and potentially be closer to future
quests or dungeons. The more guild halls, the more high profile quests will
be offered.

```

## Downtime Activities

### Work
Unfortunately, you work a side job to keep your bills paid, completely
cancelling out any living expenses.

### Help
You pay 10GP to keep your bills paid and provide for travel expenses, then help
someone accomplish their downtime. That someone may make one roll with advantage
, and may benefit from spells you cast.


### Learn Goblin from Ash
You pay 10GP to learn Goblin from Ash. You make a DC 12 investigation check.
If you succeed twice cumulatively, you learn the goblin language.

### Buy a magic item (requires magic item shop 3 upgrade)
Using 10GP to cover the bills and travel expenses, you follow some leads that
the magic shop owner offers you on finding magic items.

#### Finding the selection
Make a persuasion check, which represents you talking your way to the better
selection of magic items. The roll determines which table you'll be using. You 
may not receive any assistance with this task unless someone in the session's 
party uses their downtime to help you. You may pick a lower table if you choose.
Once you've selected your table, roll 1d4 times to see what items you find.

```
+-------+-------+
| Roll  | Table |
+-------+-------+
| 1-17  | A     |
| 18-24 | B     |
| 25-30 | C     |
+-------+-------+
```

#### Price
Roll the price for each item accordingly.
- Consumable items are half the rolled price.
- Add the cost of normal armor to that of magical armor.
- Spell scrolls are rolled after purchase, unless you cast the identify spell.

```
+-----------+----------------+-------------+
| Rarity    |     Price      |    Range    |
+-----------+----------------+-------------+
| Common    | 1d4+1 * 50gp   | 100-250     |

## Hirelings and services

### Burial (10GP)
Characters that die with at least 10GP can be buried with a 32 letter
inscription on their tombstone. One of their surviving peers comes up with this
inscription.
'
### Cleanup Crew (2GP/Day)
This crew loads a donkey cart with loot. On major roads, it travels two squares
a day and takes 1 day to load up.

### Construction/Excavation Crew (4GP/Day)
This crew consists of a large team of builders or miners that can burrow through
walls and locked doors, as well as install ladders and elevators in vertical
shafts.

### Coach(1GP/day)
High speed carriage that moves four squares per day across roads. Each night
camping with the coach counts as a full rest.

### Torchbearer(15GP deposit, 15% Commission)
A torchbearer is a commoner that will follow one adventurer closely into
dangerous situations. They may carry a light source, haul loot, or offer some
sort of special ability. They will refuse hazardous orders like scouting ahead
or opening a suspicious chest with their bare hands. The hireling office is
paid 15GP upfront, which is returned in full upon the torchbearer's safe return.

If a torchbearer is bloodied or sees an ally die, they will make a DC 15 wisdom
save to act heroically. If they fail, they will make a DC 15 intelligence save
to act in their best interest. If they fail both, they panic and retreat.

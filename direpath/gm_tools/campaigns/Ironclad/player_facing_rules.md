# Ironclad

## Meta info
This is my first attempt at writing a true sandbox campaign. The party is given
objectives for the entire campaign and no further prompting. The table is
closed, with a consistent set of players present each session. The world is
highly deadly, and geared towards tactical combat and resource management with
roleplay taking a tertiary role.

## Premise

In the aftermath of elemental evil laying waste to their homeland of Ferrus,
a small band of commoners sets out on an expedition to retrieve the three
legendary weapons that defeated the evil eons ago. Justice, Authority, and 
Stability are scattered across the island of Korrus, and they are the only means
known to take back the land of Ferrus.

The party must embark to regain the legendary weapons. The only knowledge of
this island is a single map.

## Characters

### Followers
Each player character can bring a number of followers equal to their charisma
modifier. PC can expend a bonus action to command their followers, who take the
dodge action if they aren't commanded. Unless otherwise stated, followers are
compensateda flat rate of 1GP per day.

### XP and advancement
Characters gain 10XP for each gold earned, and XP is also earned by killing
monsters. XP is divided up equally between all player characters and followers
present. This means that if a party of four gains 4 gold, each character gains
10XP ( 4 gold pieces * 10 XP per gold / 4 characters = 10 ).

### Classes
As the commoners level up, they may select adventurer classes.
Leveling up into the first level of a class does not grant starting gear for
that class.
The following classes are available in this campaign:
- alchemist
- gunner
- priest
- psion
- runesmith
- thief
- tinkerer
- warrior

### Character creation
Each player creates a commoner. Ability scores are rolled in order, 4d6 drop
lowest. All lineages in the imperial lineages book are acceptable. Background
is decided via the 1d100 backgrounds book.

## Base Camp
The base camp produces enough food to feed everyone living there and this place
is where stockpiled resources go.

## Overland Travel
Each day, the party may either move one hex in order to make time for foraging,
or may move two hexes and consume rations. Two D20s are rolled for each day of
travel. One represent's the day's travel, and the other represents the night.
If either result in a 1, the party encounters creatures.

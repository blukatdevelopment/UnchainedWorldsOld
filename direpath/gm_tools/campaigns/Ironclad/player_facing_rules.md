# Ironclad

## Meta info
This is my first attempt at writing a true sandbox campaign. The party is given
objectives for the entire campaign and no further prompting. The table is
closed, with a consistent set of players present each session. The world is
highly deadly, and geared towards tactical combat and resource management with
roleplay taking a tertiary role.

## Premise

The elementals have been unleashed on the kingdom of Ferrus, tearing through the
kings strongest warriors and laying waste to the cities. In the wake of such
destruction, the church of Kazoth(god of smithing) rallied a group of commoners
to sail to the land of Korrus and retrieve the three magical weapons used to
contain the elementals eons ago.

## Characters

### Followers
Each player character can bring a number of followers equal to their charisma
modifier. PC can expend a bonus action to command their followers, who take the
dodge action if they aren't commanded.

### XP and advancement
Characters gain 10XP for each gold earned, and XP is also earned by killing
monsters.

### Classes
As the commoners level up, they may select adventurer classes.
The following classes are available in this campaign:
- alchemist
- commoner
- gunner
- priest
- psion
- runesmith
- thief
- tinkerer
- warrior

### Roster
Commoners landed on Korrus. The following table contains their pertinent
details. Ability scores already include their lineage ability score increases.

## Base Camp
The base camp produces enough food to feed everyone living there and this place
is where stockpiled resources go.

### Moving the base camp
Instead of giving teams of workers background assignments, you may instead
employ everyone not in your adventuring party to move the base camp one
hex over the course of a week.

## Overland Travel
Each day, the party may either move one hex in order to make time for foraging,
or may move two hexes and consume rations. Two D20s are rolled for each day of
travel. One represent's the day's travel, and the other represents the night.
If either result in a 1, the party encounters creatures.

artifacts that must be retrieved to fight the elementals.

pointed ears and a shaggy mane of brown hair. She wears a tunic of animal skins
and carries a staff with vines adhering a human skull to the end. 

#### Kiss of Nerafher
When Nerafher kisses you, it leaves a green mark on your skin. You gain the ability to cast a random cantrip on command. Roll a 1d4:

A wielder may consume a hit die to cast one of the following spells:

- Blindness/Deafness

In addition, the staff can freely open or close gates into the Arden Vale's garden.

### Voices
Investigating these voices leads to skeletons scattered on the ground with
little purple flowers growing on them.
The voices will drop a few lines:
"Turn back, or the demon will trap your souls here."
"There is no hope. Get out of here."
"She's coming, run while you can."

The voices will quiet, and Nerafher will appear.

"I am Nerafher, guardian of these woods. Have you come to join my garden?"

After some back and forth, she'll propose a little game. In her garden, she's
hidden a pile of treasure. There are also great monsters wandering her land. If
the party can split any of their skulls, she'll give them a kiss.

If the party agrees, she will shake her staff and the trees above will part,
giving sunlight to the party and revealing that they are in room 1.

### Golden Light
Pursuing the light causes the voices to fade. The light leads to a clearing
where there are golden flowers growing in a thick patch.
They are in room 42. 

Nerafher appears from behind the waterfall, drying out her hair. It's then that
a minotaur enters from the North. She waves her staff at the creature and tells
it to get back, and it advances, grunting at her in abyssal "Finally.
Hold still." He'll pick her up, and she'll call out to the party to help. She'll
kiss the one who dealt the killing blow, and then disappear with a giggle.

### Yellow Sleepers
Disturbing the flowers causes a plume of pollen that forces a DC 15 CON save
to avoid falling under their effect. The effected creature just lays among
the flowers. The effect wears off after ten mintues if the effected creature is
not among the flowers. A creature caught in the yellow sleepers will remain
there until they die of thirst and decompose, fertilizing the patch.

### Red Berries

## Hirkidw River
A river that's said to carry souls to the 9 hells.

The river's boat comes out at night, and is driven by a vampire named Grace,
who carries and pets a cat.
In actuality, she is a pawn controlled by the Gattogat she's carrying. The
Gattogat's name is Horgur, and he is eating the souls ushered to the river.
If attacked, Horgur will raise an army of 12 skeletons in the banks of the
river and attempt to flee. At the head of the river, there's an island in the
river where Horgur keeps his horde of loot.

# Imperial Lineages

The fall of the dwarven empires brought trade to a screeching halt and forced
entire cities to be abandoned in favor of productive farmlands. The power vacuum
became the foundation of the meteoric rise of the human empires. With them,
a wave of colonization that rippled through every land that could be connected
reliably reached by ship or trade caravan. Roll a 1d8 for a random lineage.

As the human empires rose, a sharp divide was drawn between those that gained
power and those that lost it in the new arrangement. The upper empire consists
of those who took positions of wealth and power.

## 1 Imperial
The humans at the heart of the empire reaped vast wealth which they used to
engender a culture of conspicious spending, send their children through
schooling, and assume the positions of greatest power.

carry with them the reputation for the absolute finest weapons and armor.

each conventional story. Equipped with open-air courtyards, bunks, baths, and
workshops, the coggers lived up to their name by initially converitng piles
of raw metal into gears, springs, nails, and screws. Since then the complexity
of their products has grown with the appetite of the empires.

Those unaligned with imperial interests, or otherwise not well-suited as
subjects found themselves excluded from imperial society, except as second-class
citizens. 

## 5 Soot
The humans that first emerged from shifts in once-dwarven mines quickly took
on this name due to the pitch black coal dust clinging to their forms. The title
has since been used for all sorts of laborers, from fishermen, to farmers, to
ranchers, because of the common layer of dirt and grime that finds it's way on
their clothes. Your resume is written with the callouses on your hands.

The empire's hard labor once rested upon human shoulders. Then came the
hard-working beast folk that sought to make a name for themselves in the empire.

barber, librarian, or doctor sets the example of hope needed for the others to
keep pulling, pushing, and hauling for their children to one day live a better
life than they do.

## 7 Uprooted
In the wake of imperial expansion, strategic resources were seized in the name
of a growing industrial appetite. Mine after mine, tunnel after tunnel, became
property of kings and emperors. Those that resisted discovered the extent of
empirical science and magic. The desheveled masses were forced to retreat
increasingly further into the bowels of the Earth, or else surface in hopes
of finding caves not yet under imperial control. These dwarves were historically
the first to reside entirely above ground, a displaced people neither suited
nor interested in taking up the life of surface dwellers.

Some channel the power of the weave by studying symbols. These symbols are known as runes. Once carved, runes contain powerful bindings to the weave that can be invoked to cast spells. The

## Features

### Runebook
You have a book of runes for your spells. You start with four cantrips and five
1st level spells from the runesmith spell list and may add additional spells. 
Each level you gain, you may learn 1 new spell from the runesmith spell list.

#### Copying Spells
You may copy spells from a spellbook or scroll if they are on the runesmith spell list. For every level
of the spell you are copying, you require one hour of time and 10GP of paper, inks, and materials. When
you gain subsequent levels, you may learn one spell from the spell list at no cost.

### Runesmithery
You've practiced with runes and can now carve them into flat stones during a partial or full rest. During a partial rest,
you may inscribe stones with the runes of a particular spell. Each rune you carve requires 2 silver pieces
worth of materials needed to make arcane ink. The base number of runes you may have active across all your rune stones
at any time can be found in the runes column for your level.

#### Runesmithing 2nd level and higher spells
Spells of higher levels require more more runes. Specifically, the spell level indicates how many runes are required to smith a runestone of that level. A 2nd level takes two runes, a 3rd takes 3, and so forth.

#### Runesmithing Cantrips
Cantrips are smaller spells, and you can fit 6 of them on a single runestone. When you expend a rune to smith a cantrip stone, you may mix and match any combination of 6 cantrips onto it. For instance, you may pick 6 copies of firebolt, or you may have three copies of firebolt and one copy each of minor illusion, minor conjuration, and mold earth.

### Ritual Casting
Your knowledge of certain spells allows you to channel magic through their runes through ritual. You may cast any spell marked as
a ritual using ritual casting. When you do so, the spell's casting time increases by 10 minutes. Ritual casting does not consume
runes, nor any other magical resources, as the ritual itself powers the cast.

### Runecasting
When holding a rune stone in your hand, you may use an action to release the stored spell from the stone.
Intelligence is your spellcasting abiility. The rune stone you cast with acts as a spell focus, and is 
consumed after the spell is cast.
Your spell DC (difficulty class) is 8+proficiency bonus + intelligence modifier.
Your spell attack modifier is proficiency bonus + intelligence modifier.

### Extra Cantrip
You learn one additional Cantrip from the runesmith spell list.

### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

### Runecasting Style
When you reach 4th level, you define your style for the rest of your career.

#### Spell Hoarder
You have an insatiable appetite for spellcasting, and you are constantly reading
through the literature. You learn an extra spell, and each time you level up from
now on you may learn one additional spell.

#### Rune Hoarder
Your runes are made with a special, more expensive technique that is less
taxing to your magical energy. As such, you may smith a number of additional
runes equal to your intelligence modifier plus your proficiency bonus. Your
runes now cost 5 silver to produce, instead of 2.

#### Cantrip Savant
You have learned to attune gems to your magical aura using a special gauntlet.
The gauntlet requires 10GP of materials to produce, and has a slot for a gem on
each finger and on your palm. Each gem must be worth at least 5gp in order for
you to inscribe a cantrip onto it and insert it into the slot. Each cantrip on
your gauntlet can be cast an unlimited number of times. The gauntlet holds up
to six cantrips, and only works for your unqiue magical aura.

### Extra Cantrip
You learn one additional Cantrip from the runesmith spell list.

#### Rune Artisan
You have learned to smith advanced rune stones. Each time you carve runes onto a
rune stone, you may expend an additional rune to smith an artisinal rune stone
with one of the following properties:
- Upcast - The spell is cast as if from two levels higher.
- Blast - If the spell deals damage, you may reroll the the damage and choose the highest.
- Guided - If this spell involves one or more spell attacks, they are made with advantage.
- Surge - If the spell forces targets to make a saving throw, they must make it with disadvantage.
- Remote - This rune can be invoked from a range of up to 1 mile. Ranged spells that target a point select the runestone's position, or select a random target within range if they target a creature.

### Runesmithing Technique
When you reach 7th level, you learn one of the following techniques.

#### Duplicate Inscription
When you smith a runestone during a full rest, you may make a duplicate
runestone which contains the same spell and requires the same material
components, but does not count against the number of runes you've used.
After you use this feature, you may not use it again until the runestone and
it's duplicate have been cast.

#### Glyph
You may now draw glyphs, which can be drawn on any 10ft square surface
(which it exactly covers) and use
5gp of alchemical ink. Drawing time is 10 minutes per spell level, ranging from
10 minutes for a 1st level spell, to 1 hour for a 5th level spell. The runes
spent to make a glyph do not count toward your total number of glyphs, and the
glyph remains dormant until activated or destroyed by smearing the ink. When
you draw a glyph, you must specify a trigger. Triggers are simple conditions
such as when:
- a command phrase is spoken
- a creature touches the glyph
- the door the glyph is drawn on is opened
- the giant the glyph is drawn on moves 5ft
- a day passes
- the glyph is exposed to light/darkness
- the glyph gets wet

A glyph's spell DC is 13 and it's attack modifier bonus is +5. It will target
the nearest creature to it, a creature touching it, or else center the spell
on itself.

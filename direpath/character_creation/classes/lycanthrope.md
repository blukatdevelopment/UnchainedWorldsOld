## Features

### Lycanthrope Form
Choose from werewolf, wererat, or werebear. There are certain triggers that
will cause you to succeed a wisdom saving throw or transform into this form 
against your will, at which time your primal instincts will overtake your mind
and you will lose control of your actions for 1d4 hours. During this time, the
GM can intermittently or entirely control your actions. All of your lycanthrope
abilities and features are active during an unwilling shift. When you leave your
lycanthrope form from an unwilling shift, you have 1 hit point and your clothing
is damaged according to the extent of your growth during the transformation. If
you resist a trigger, you are immune being triggered involuntarily for the next
hour. During an uncontrolled shift, you may make a DC 14 wisdom saving throw
once per minute to end the transformation. If you roll a natural 20 on this
save, the uncontrolled shift becomes a controlled shift.

+--------------------------------+----+
```

### Controlled Shift
You've learned to control your shift into your beast form. 
You may use your bonus action to expend a hit die and shift at will. When you
shift this way, you are in full control of yourself. That control lasts for
1 minute. When this time runs out, you may succeed a DC 12 wisdom save in order
to maintain control and either remain in a controlled shift, or transform back
into your humanoid form. If you fail this save, you lose control and your shift
becomes an uncontrolled shift.

#### Tough hide
You have resistance to non-magical and non-silvered slashing, piercing, and
bludgeoning damage when shifted.

### Extra atack
In addition to any attacks you would normally make when you use the attack
action, you may make one additional attack.

## Lycanthrope forms

Your size is medium and your speed is 40ft. Your maximum hit points are

Acrobatics checks and strength saving throws are made with advantage. Your 
attacks gain advantage when made against an enemy within 5ft of an ally that is
not unconscious.

#### Jaws
At level one, you can use your lycanthrope form's natural attacks.
When you make an unarmed attack, you can use your jaws to deal piercing damage
equal to 1d6+strength. 

#### Howl
At level two, you learn to harness the ferocity of your lycanthrope form.
You may use your action to release a bloodcurdling howl, which will trigger
any lycanthropes that can hear you with a DC16 wisdom save, and which will grant
you 1d10 temporary hit points. Any creature within 10 feet of you must succeed a
DC 15 wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the start of your next
turn. Once you use this ability, you may not use it again until your next shift.

recalculated to be 8+CON per hit die during this transformation. 
Acrobatics checks and dexterity saving throws are made with advantage.

#### Incisors
At level one, you can use your lycanthrope form's natural attacks.
When you make an unarmed attack, you can bite down to deal piercing damage equal
to 1d6+strength. When this attack is made with advantage, you deal critical
damage and that enemy cannot make attacks of opportunity against you until the
start of the next turn.

#### Dark vision
At level two, you senses in your lynthrope form are heightened.
In darkness you can see 30 feet as if bright light, and for 30 more feet as if
in dim light. You cannot see colors this way. Dim light appears as bright light
to you. You receive disadvantage on attacks and ability or skill checks made 
when exposed to sunlight.

#### Unnatural Mobility
At level two, you learn to harness the agility of your form.
You may use your bonus action to perform the dash, dodge, or hide actions.

#### Fury swipes
At level four, you learn to channel your fury into a series of slashes.
When both hands are free, you may use your action to swipe 1d4 times.
You use your dexterity modifier for these attacks, and they deal slashing damage
equal to 1d4+dexterity.

### Werebear

#### Powerful physique
At level one, you can transform into your lycanthrope form.
Your size is large and your movement is 25ft. Your maximum hit points are 
recalculated to be 12+CON per hit die. Athletics checks and 
constitution saving throws are made with advantage. When you take the attack 
action, you may attack one extra time.

#### Claws
At level one, you can use your lycanthrope form's natural attacks.
You gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed. When making an unarmed
attack, you can use your claws to deal slashing damage equal to 1d6+strength.

#### Bear Hug

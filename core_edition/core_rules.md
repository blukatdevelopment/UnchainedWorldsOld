# Unchained Worlds

# Foreword

## What is Core Edition?
This system is designed with the following principles and assumptions:

- Table of 2-5 players
- Sandbox-styled play
- Lore from Crucible
- High improvisation
- High trust
- "There is no such thing as flavor."
- Classes are committed to their premises

## How do I play Unchained Worlds?
- A **keeper** selects or creates a gameworld
- The **players** create characters and explore that world

# Philosophy
As a table, review this section. Revise anything you disagree with.

## Safety Tools
- Trigger warnings: give players a heads-up on disturbing content
- Pregame discussion: List player sensitivities, make any accommodations
- X-card: Anyone can use this to skip the current scene

## The Social Contract
- Set expectations for behavior
- Decide how tricky situations are handled
- Call out priorities/values

### Example Contract
- Keeper's rulings are absolute
- Inner-party conflict requires out of character consent
- Take turns in the spotlight
- Accept the outcome of the dice

# Creating your character
This handbook provides a skeletal set of character creation options, and are not intended for use in tyical campaigns. Work with your keeper to determine what supplemental books you will use when creating your characters.

## Abilities

### What are abilities?
When you attempt to perform a task that involves natural ability, your ability scores help determine the odds of success. Here’s a breakdown of what different abilities help you with.

#### Strength
Lift, climb, carry, grapple, throw, punch, and perform tasks that require brute force.
The total ammount one can carry is 6 times their strength score, minimum 18lb, maximum 120lb.

#### Dexterity
Sprint, jump, duck, dodge, sneak, and perform acrobatic maneuvers.

#### Constitution
Resist the effects of poison, toxins, fatigue, and illness. Determines your maximum hit points.

#### Intelligence
Process, calculate, and reason through complex information. 

#### Wisdom
Intuit, deduce, and read between the lines. Particularly good for resisting mind-altering magic, reading the intentions of others, and perceiving the world around you.

#### Charisma
Joke, flatter, persuade, lie, bluff, perform, and intimidate others. Useful wherever talking or looking good is needed.

### What are ability scores?
An ability score is a number ranging from 1 to 20 which quantifies your ability’s potency. When making an ability check, you roll a 1d20 and add the ability’s modifier. To calculate the ability modifier, take half the distance from 10, rounded down. Here’s a chart.

| Score | Modifier |
|:------|:---------|
| 20    | +5       |
| 18-19 | +4       |
| 16-17 | +3       |
| 14-15 | +2       |
| 12-13 | +1       |
| 10-11 | 0        |
| 8-9   | -1       |
| 6-7   | -2       |
| 4-5   | -3       |
| 2-3   | -4       |
| 1     | -5       |

### Generating ability scores

#### Predetermined arrays
If you do not want to trust your fate to the dice, you may use an array of predetermined values. Values are not provided in order, and can be assigned arbitrarily. Work with your DM to determine which of these will work for your campaign, if any.
`Standard array: [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]`
`Min-max array: [17, 14, 13, 10, 9, 7]`
`Commoner array: [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`
`Demigod array: [18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18]`

#### Roll scores
- Roll 4d6, drop the lowest roll
- This is your strength score
- Repeat for the other abilities
- If you don't get at least one 14, reroll
- When you're done, you may swap one pair of scores

## Skills
- A skill is knowledge and experience on a subject
- Ability checks using a skill benefit from the proficiency bonus
- A proficiency bonus increases with level

## Class
- Decides starting hit points and background knowledge
- Offers class features when gaining levels

### Advancement
As you earn XP, you gain levels according to the table below.
| Level |  Total XP   |
|:------|:------------|
|   1   |           0 |
|   2   |          30 |
|   3   |          90 |
|   4   |         150 |
|   5   |         300 |
|   6   |         450 |
|   7   |         600 |
|   8   |        1000 |
|   9   |        2000 |
|  10   |        3000 |

# Combat

## Initiative
In combat, combatants take turns. The combat order is known as initiative. 

### Standard
- Everyone makes a DEX check
- Everyone goes one at a time, highest check first
- Ties are broken with a contested DEX check

### (Variant)Team initiative
- Each team rolls a D6
- Highest team goes first, together
- Lowest team goes next, together
- Ties are broken by a reroll

## On your turn
On each turn, you receive the following:
- 1 action
- 1 bonus action
- 1 free object interaction
- 1 reaction
- Movement equal to your movement speed

### Actions in combat
There is an assortment of actions you may use in combat.

- Attack: You may make an melee or ranged attack. You may also attempt to grapple or shove a creature, which requires a contested strength check made against either a strength or dexterity check(their choice).
- Cast A Spell: You may cast a spell which as a casting time of one action.
- Dash: You gain movement equal to your current movement. For example, if you had 30ft of movement, you would gain 30ft by dashing.
- Disengage: Normally, an enemy may take an attack of opportunity when you leave their melee range. Disengaging prevents this.
- Dodge: Attack rolls made against you are made with disadvantage if you can see the attacker. Dexterity saving throws are made with advantage.
- Help: You can aid another creature in completing a task, giving them advantage with it. Or, you may distract an enemy you are within 5ft of, giving the first attack made against them advantage.
- Hide: Provided you have entered a space that is obscured from sight, you may hide. The keeper will likely ask for a stealth check made against passive nearby creature's perception.
- Ready: You declare an action(and potentially movement) that you will use under a certain condition(such as if a creature turns hostile). If that condition is met, your readied action is triggered, using your reaction to perform it. If you prepare to cast a spell, it uses any relevant resources as if you had actually cast the spell, regardless of whether it was triggered.
- Search: You seek to find something. Your keeper will likely request an investigation or perception check.

#### How to make attack rolls
- Roll 1d20
- A 1 is a critical failure and automatically misses
- A 20 is a critical hit and automatically hits
- Add your ability modifier(strength or dexterity, depending on weapon)
- Add proficiency bonus if you're proficient with this weapon

#### How to make damage rolls
- Roll damage dice for weapon
- Add your ability modifier(strength or dexterity, depending on weapon)
- If critical hit, roll double the normal number of dice

### Bonus actions
Some spells and special abilities consume bonus actions instead of regular actions. Actions and bonus actions are not interchangeable.

### Free object interactions
Some actions such as storing or retrieving an object from your inventory, opening a door, speaking a six second message, or picking up an object
from the ground.

### Reactions
Some spells can be cast using a reaction when some trigger (such as being attacked or falling) takes place. In addition, you may expend a reaction to perform a melee attack against an enemy who is moving out of engagement range.

### Movement
Combat is centered around 5ft increments of distance. You may move in these increments. Once you have moved your maximum movement speed in one turn, you cannot move again until the start of your next turn. Moving 5ft counts against all your movement speeds. This means if you have 30ft movement and 15 flying, you may fly 15ft and walk 15ft, but you cannot walk 30ft and then fly 15ft.

#### Jumping
Jumping from more than 5ft requires 10ft of movement. When making a high jump, your body raises an amount of feet equal to 3 + your strength modifier. When long jumping with a running start, you move an amount of feet equal to 5 + your strength modifier + proficiency bonus.

#### Difficult terrain
Difficult terrain requires you to move more slowly. This means that for every 5ft of distance covered in difficult terrain, you must exert 10ft of movement. Examples of difficult terrain:
- Knee-deep mud
- slippery ice
- climbing up or down without a climbing speed (which will likely also require a dexterity or strength check)
- Swimming without a swimming speed
- sand

#### Fresh and Iron Rations
Fresh rations are generally fresh produce, meat, bread, and similar foods which spoil 7 days after purchase. Iron rations are made of ingredients such as travel bread, fruit preserves, fruit leather, jerky, potted meat, noodles, and pemican. Iron rations are generally shelf stable for multiple months at a time.

#### Healer's Kit
A kit filled with gauze, scissors, bandages, salves, and other medicinal gear. Has 10 charges. When you use this kit on yourself or another creature, make a wisdom check to determine the outcome.

|     Roll     |          Outcome           |
|:-------------|:---------------------------|
| 1 or less    | Takes 1d4 piercing damage. |
| 2-5          | No effect.                 |
| 6-10         | Stabilized if not already. |
| 11-15        | Heals 1d4 hit points.      |
| 16-20        | Heal 1d6 hit points.       |
| 21 or higher | Heal 1d8 hit points.       |

#### Flask of oil
A flask of oil can be thrown to create a 5ft puddle or soak an enemy. If lit, an oil-soaked creature takes 1d8+2 fire damage, and 1d6 fire damage on each subsequent turn until extinguished. A creature that starts it's turn in or enters a fire makes a DC 14 DEX save to avoid 1d6 fire damage.

#### Potion of Healing
A flask of pink liquid which heals 2d4+2 hit points when consumed.

#### Caltrops
You may drop caltrops over a space of four 5ft squares that are connected. When you do, any creature who enters that space must make a DC 14 dex save. On a failure, the creature receives 1 piercing damage and their movement is reduced to 0. A creature who moves carefully treats the square as difficult terrain and rolls normally. A creature who moves normally rolls with disadvantage.

#### Weapon properties

##### Ammunition
Weapons with the ammunition property require ammunition to make ranged attacks. Each attack expends one piece of ammunication. Retrieving the ammunition is part of the attack. You can recover half your expended ammunication by spending one minute to search the battlefield. When you use a weapon with the ammunition property to make a melee attack, it's treated as an improvised weapon.

##### Finesse
Attacks with this weapon can use your choice of strength or dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls, and both rolls must use the same modifier.

##### Heavy
Small creatures receive disadvantage on Attack rolls with heavy weapons.

##### Light
When you make an attack with a light weapon in one hand, you may use your bonus action to make an attack using a light weapon in another hand. This attack's damage does not benefit from your ability modifier.

##### Loading
Each time you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to make an attack with a weapon posessing the loading property, you can only fire once, regardless of how many attacks you have.

##### Range
A ranged weapon has a range specified in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The first number in the range is the normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon's long range. Attacking beyond normal range confers disadvantage on the attack roll. You cannot make attacks beyond the long range. Ranged attacks have disadvantage if made within 5ft of a hostile creature.

##### Reach
This weapon gains an additional 5 feet of range when attacking, as well as determining reach for opportunity attacks.

##### Special
This weapon has unique properties delivered by name in the special weapons section below.

##### Thrown
You can throw thrown weapons to make a ranged Attack. You use the same modifier for the thrown attack as you would make for the melee attack.

##### Two-handed
This weapon requirees both hands to make attacks.

##### Versatile
This weapon can be used with one hand, or with two hands. The two-handed damage value appears in parentheses after the property.

##### Improvised Weapons
At the keeper's discretion, a an improvised weapon may be used to inflict more damage than an unarmed attack. If it resembles a weapon, such as a club, it may be used as such with the same damage, proficiency, and ability modifier. If it doesn't resemble a weapon, it deals at most 1d4 damage, has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

##### Silvered Weapons
One silvered weapon or ten pieces of silvered ammunition generally costs 100gp. They perform identically to their normal counterparts, with the exception that some enemies are weak to silver.

##### Special Weapons
Lance: Attacks within 5 feet have disadvantage. The weapon requires two hands when you're not mounted.

Net: Creatures large or smaller are restrained when hit by a net until freed. Breaking out requires a DC 11 strength check. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroyes the net, ending the restrained effect. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of how many attacks you otherwise have.

## Physical needs

### Water
An adventurer needs to drink at least one gallon of water each day, or lose one stamina die. If they have a water container, they may use it throughout the day,  refilling it at water sources, if any can be found nearby. In extremely hot or  dry terrain, an adventurer instead needs to drink two gallons.

### Food
An adventure needs to eat at least one pound of food each day, or lose one stamina die.

### Sleep
An adventurer must sleep at least 6 hours each day. Failing this, they lose one stamina die each time each morning without sleep. One may not sleep in armor.

### Stamina Dice
An adventurer has stamina dice to measure their state of physical endurance. They may not expend a stamina die if they have none left. If an adventurer loses a stamina die when they have none left, they must succeed a DC 15 constitution save to avoid falling unconscious for 1d4 hours. If you lose stamina dice when unconscious in this way, roll the die and subtract it from your hit points. If your hit points fall below 1 this way, you die. An adventurer has a maximum of two stamina dice per level.

### Clothing
If exposed to the elements in an extremely hot or cold environment, an adventurer must succeed a DC 14 constitution saving throw or lose a stamina die. This check repeats for each hour spent exposed to the elements. An adventurer may avoid these checks by staying in shelter or wearing clothing appropriate to the weather.

### Rest
An adventurer may wish to rest to recover their physical and mental stamina as  well as perform maintenance of their gear. A rest takes 8 hours, and can occur once per day. Provided an adventurer is not suffering from starvation, exposure to harsh elements(such as ice or desert sun), or dehydration, they may regain one stamina die for each amenity that their rest includes(See amenities table below). Adventurers may also expend one stamina die and roll it, add their CON modifier, and restore that many hit points. If you spend a full day doing nothing but resting and light activities such as gathering firewood, cooking, and inscribing runestones, you may rest twice.

### Conditions

#### Down
A creature is downed when their hit points fall below 1. A downed creature is paralyzed, knocked prone, and incoming attacks deal critical damage. At the start of a downed creature's turn, it must expend a stamina die to make a death saving throw, or else immediately die. The expended stamina die is added to the creature's hit points. If the hit points hit exactly 0, the creature is stable and unconscious for 1d4 hours at 1 HP. If higher, the creature wakes up at the end of their current turn in initiative. A creature may be stabilized if a creature uses it's action to make a DC 15 medicine check from within 5ft.

## Magic
Certain classes, abilities, boons, etc may offer you the ability to cast spells.

### Spells

#### Level
Spells range in level from cantrip (0) to legendary (6). This indicates not only how powerful they are, but also how much magical energy is required to cast a given spell. Most classes will have their own resource spent by casting spells. If you hold an action to cast a spell, any resources for that spell are consumed regardless of whether they 

#### Distance
Some spells have a maximum range they can be cast from, like 120 feet. Others require physical touch, denoted by range: touch. Spells with range: self can only be cast on the caster.

#### Casting Speed
Casting speed is how long it takes to cast a spell.

#### Duration
Decides how long a spell's effects will last. A spell with instantaneous duration ends immediately.

#### Concentration
When a spell has concentration, it means that the duration can be cut short if the caster takes damage and fails a concentration saving throw whose DC is 10 or half the damage received, whichever is higher. You also lose concentration when unconscious, incapacitated, or dead.

#### Areas of effect

##### Cone
A cone's as long as it is wide. This is to say that a 15ft cone is 15 feet long, and it's diameter at the base is 15ft.

##### Cube
A cube's sides are all the same, so a 5ft cube is 5ft by 5ft by 5ft.

##### Cylinder
A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle with a radius described by the spell. The circle's either on the groundor at a height specified by the spell. A second circle directly above the first is the top of the cylinder, and anything betweenthe two is inside it.

##### Line
The line extends from it's point of originatn in a straight path up to it's length and covers an area defined its width, provided in the spell.

##### Sphere
The sphere extends outward from a point a distance equal to it's radius. Anything a distance equal or less than the radius of the sphere from it's center is inside it.

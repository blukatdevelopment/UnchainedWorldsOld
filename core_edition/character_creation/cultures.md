# Age of Man
```
Gone is the age of titans.
Felled are the great brutes which feasted on bone of man and god.
Brave founders repelled them!
To the snowy mountains!
To the black ocean!
To the bowels of the Earth!
Farewell, titans.
The world will rise once more
standing hand in hand
in the glory of the empire!
- Anthem of the Empire of Man

The empire of man expanded one city at a time, propelled by the many peoples'
revulsion toward their titan overlords, consuming the world. It's collapse was
as inevitable as it's rise. Once the last overlord fell, the empire boiled over
in a war of self-determination for many of it's constituent states. When the dust
settled, only a shriveled core of the empire remained and the remainder of the
world exploded in unrestricted vitality and growth in spite of the great
network of trade routes vanishing overnight.

## 1 Gold Robes
![Gold robes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blukatdevelopment/UnchainedWorlds/main/img/culture_gold_robes.jpg "Gold Robes")
Those who benefited most from the empire of man's core's wealth and abundance of imports long for the return of the empire. Named for their status symbol, each individual in gold robe society wears a robe with gold fiber sewed in. The greater the prestige, the more gold and rarer the fabric used in the robe's construction.

Gold robe cuisine consists of only the finest and most exotic ingredients avalable. Like fashion, the favorable dishes are in constant rotation, and it is a gold robe's duty to keep abreast with gustatory trends. The typical gold robe accent tends towards longer, drawn out syllables with a formal grandeousness. Even the poorest of gold robes who do not live in luxury homes still furnish their living spaces with decorations to flaunt what wealth they do have.

Common phrases gold robes use include "gilded"/"pyrite"/"last week" to mock bad fashion, "shiny"/"smooth"/"frilled" to compliment others. Crafting insults is an art form and a game of wit for many Gold Robes.

## 2 The silent
![The Silent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blukatdevelopment/UnchainedWorlds/main/img/culture_silent.jpg "The Silent")
These folk practice stoic traditions handed down to them from various magical creatures. Children of the silent take a vow of silence from a young age, and their rite of passage into adulthood is to confirm their vow by the removal of their tongue. To communicate, the silent use a variety of hand signs known as handspeak. The ways of the silent are guarded from outsiders, and involve a harsh regimen of martial arts, scholarly study, and magical training.

Only a select few mages outside of the silent culture know it's origin. The silent culture was created by a legendary band of titan slayers known as the Radiant Order. They created the Silent culture to safeguard any of the magical secrets that could be used to bring about a new age of Titans. Rather than destroy this knowledge, individual silent are trusted only with pieces of the entire puzzle, and it is strictly forbidden to share those secrets except when training successors. The only major exception to the secrecy of the silent is in communication with mages deemed responsible enough to cooperate in this goal.

Without tongues, the silent place minimal consideration for the pleasure of eating. Their meals consist of whatever is simple and nutritious, often foregoing kitchens in their homes. Their robes signify their station within the silent order, and often contain coloring and patterns related to their specific knowledge silo.

Cogger culture holds tiny folk as special. This is partly due to the history of tiny folk volunteering to mend items, but also due to their ability to make very fine changes and fit inside clockwork devices to perform maintenance.

Many soots found their way into deep folk warrens when the boom and bust left them jobless, or when industrial accidents left entire families of orphans. The tradition of soots visiting warrens to check on rehomed friends and loved ones has resulted in the singular channel of trade that the communities are familiar with, often exporting fungi and monster parts.

Some channel the power of the weave by studying symbols. These symbols are known as runes. Once carved, runes contain powerful bindings to the weave that can be invoked to cast spells. The runesmith is one who dedicates their life to the art of the rune.

## Hit points
Roll 3d4 and add your CON modifier three times(minimum 1HP). These are your starting hit points. Every time you gain a level, you may roll again and keep the total if it is higher.

## Features

### Runebook
You have a book of runes for your spells. You start with four cantrips and five 1st level spells from the runesmith spell list and may add additional spells.  Each level you gain, you may learn 1 new spell from the runesmith spell list. If the runebook is lost, a new one can be crafted from 10GP of materials.

#### Copying Spells
You may copy spells from a spellbook or scroll if they are on the runesmith spell list. For every level of the spell you are copying, you require one hour of time and 10GP of paper, inks, and materials. When you gain subsequent levels, you may learn one spell from the spell list at no cost.

### Runesmithing
You've practiced with runes and can now inscribe them onto flat stones. Over the course of one hour you may inscribe a single runestone using a one ounce bottle(15gp) of rune ink. A runestone weighs 5lb.

### Runecasting
When holding a rune stone in your hand, you may use an action to release the stored spell from the stone. Intelligence is your spellcasting abiility. Your spell DC (difficulty class) is 8+proficiency bonus + intelligence modifier. Your spell check modifier is proficiency bonus + intelligence modifier. When you cast a spell, make a spell check to determine whether the rune is destroyed. The DCs for each spell level are listed below.

|Spell Level|DC|
|:----------|:-|
| Cantrip   | 8|
|       1st |10|
|       2nd |12|
|       3rd |14|
|       4th |16|
|       5th |18|


### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

### Specialty
When you reach 6th level, you reach one of the following achievements

#### Somatic Casting
You've learned to breathe your life essence into runes while tracing them in the air with your finger. This creates a glowing image of the rune that erupts into brilliant light when cast. When you cast a spell this way, it consumes a number of stamina dice equal to triple the spell level and does not require a rune stone(or 2 stamina dice for cantrips).

#### Rune Tattoo
Instead of inscribing stone, you may inscribe skin. You tattoo a spell onto someone's skin using two ounces of rune ink(30gp). A person may have up to three tattoos, one on each wrist, and one on the forehead. The tattooed person may expend stamina dice equal to the spell level(0 for cantrips) to cast the spell. They use their INT mod for the spell check, and failing causes the tattoo to burn away and deal 1d10 radiant damage in the process. You may not have a spell on a runestone and tattoo at the same time.

#### Signature spell
Choose a spell you know, and raise it's spell level by one. Work with the keeper to make a suitably more powerful version of this spell. This spell bears your name, and is written in your spell book in addition to the unaltered version of the spell.

#### Wands
You may now cast spells using magic wands. When runesmithing, you may inscribe a spell onto a wand instead of a runestone. When you fail your spellcheck with a wand, the wand loses it's charge. You may recharge a wand by consuing a number of stamina dice twice that of the spell level.(2 for cantrips)

#### Glyph
You may now draw glyphs, which can be drawn on any 10ft square surface (which it exactly covers) and use 3 ounces of rune ink. It takes 1 hour to draw. You may have any number of drawn glyphs and still have a runestone carved with the same spell. When you draw a glyph, you must specify a trigger. Triggers are simple conditions such as when:
- a command phrase is spoken
- a creature touches the glyph
- the door the glyph is drawn on is opened
- the giant the glyph is drawn on moves 5ft
- a day passes
- the glyph is exposed to light/darkness
- the glyph gets wet

A glyph's spell DC and its spell modifier are the same as yours. It will target the nearest creature to it, a creature touching it, or else center the spell on itself, according to your instructions.

### Create Spell
Work with the keeper to create one spell of any level.

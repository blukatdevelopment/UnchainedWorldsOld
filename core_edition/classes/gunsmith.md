## Features

Firearms require an action to reload when empty, and you are skilled with them.
Choose one of the following techniques:
- Careful aim: you can expend a stamina die and add to your attack roll with a firearm.

### Smithing
You may smith guns and ammunition using scrap. Each unit of scrap weighs 10lbs, and metal objects can be used as scrap. Over the course of 8 hours, you may do up to 10 scrap worth of crafting on the items below. For instance, you might make two pistols, or half of a match long gun to be finished on another day. This requires a workshop with tools.

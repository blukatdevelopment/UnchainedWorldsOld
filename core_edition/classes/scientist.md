## Features

### Scientific Instruments
Discovery demands the collection of meaningful data, and you are nothing if not prepared for this. You can maintain on your person a number of scientific instruments equal to 2 + your intelligence modifier, minimum of 3 in total. You may choose them from the instruments list. You start with two instruments, and constructing a new instrument requires 5gp of materials arranged over the course of 4 hours with tinkerer's tools. If an instrument runs out of expendable supplies, it requires one hour and 5sp of materials to restore.

### Concealed defense
You have learned to disguise a weapon on your person, in case you need defense on short notice. Guards are unlikely to recognize this weapon, nor confiscate it in secured locations. Choose one of the following:
- Switchblade shoe (dagger)
- Hand puppet concealing a hand crossbow
- Cane sword (longsword)
- Umbrella with hidden speartip (spear)
- Blowgun disguised as flute

### Fundamental Truth
You learn one principle that applies broadly to your body of work. This guides your attitudes you use to ask questions and answer them.

#### Know your enemy
When you spend one hour and a stamina die performing an autopsy of a monster's corpse, you gain an intimate understanding of it's anatomy. You learn details such as movement speed, resistances, and abilities. With the details fresh in your mind, you have advantage on attack rolls made against this monster. This familiarity is lost when you perform another autopsy, as the new monster takes the place of the old in your mind. You retain facts about it, but lose advantage. Humanoids, slimes, and the undead cannot be targeted with this ability.

#### Know yourself
You refuse to lose yourself in your pursuits. Through self-experimentation and careful training, you unlock your true potential. You gain every feat for your culture, regardless of whether you meet the ability score requirements.

#### Knowledge for it's own sake
Your focus on learning to learn, and do so indiscriminantly. This unlocks your true learning potential. When you make an investigation check, you may now add a 1d4 to your roll.

### Old Reliable
Through your experimentation, you've finished a prototype weapon for your personal protection. Choose one prototype weapon from the prototype weapons list. You may replace your prototype weapon with a new one by crafting with 20gp of materials during a rest.

### Field of expertise
Your studies have lead you to break new ground in research. Choose one field of expertise.

#### Clockwork Expert
While gears are simple components, you've managed to extend their reach considerably. You gain access to the new autocrossbow prototype weapon as well as the gear crawler instrument.

#### Paranormal Expert
If your predecessors could only see you now! You've managed to prove the existence of ghosts, ghouls, and other undead creatures. You may now perform autopsies on their corpses. Your gain access to the new Lightning Pack prototype weapon, as well as two instruments: the Soul Trap and arcane sight goggles.

#### Life sciences expert
You become obsessed with the creation of life, and it pays off! You may now perform an autopsy on a medium creature's corpse. When you do, make a DC 15 arcana check. If you succeed, you raise the creature from the dead. They retain all their memories, but are considered undead from now on. Each time you try to raise the creature from the dead again, the DC raises by 2.

#### Nuclear expert
You wield an energy that is invisible to the naked eye, oh except for when it glows green! You gain access to the Magnetron Ray prototype weapon as well as the following instruments: Tritium headlamp and leaded underwear.

### Branch out
After achieving expertise, you set your sights on a new interest:

#### Clanker
You gain proficiency in medium and heavy armor.

#### Psion Adept
You gain a Psionic die of D2 from the psion class, and learn two spells from the psion spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability. Your psionic die returns after completing a rest.

#### Rune Adept
You create your own runebook with three first level spells in it, and may expend your stamina die to smith 1d4 runes over the course of 10 minutes. You may have four rules at one time, and each rune requires 5sp of materials.

#### Alchemist Adept
You may expend a hit die and ten minutes and 10gp of materials to brew a potion. You learn one of the following alchemist techniques:
- Tinker's Best Friend
- Soldier's Courage
- The Poisoner's Purple Pantsuit
- Healer's Shimmy

#### Bulk Up
You spend time with physical exercise and using carefully crafted supplements, and your gains are epic. You gain +2 to both your strength and constitution ability scores, and your hit points are recalculated as 3d6+(3)CON.

### Capstone
Now that you've proven those idiots wrong and made a name for yourself, you make your greatest achievement yet.

#### It lives!
You create an artificial lifeform, an amalgam of corpse parts that comes together to make one whole. The creature has the following stats. They inherit your weapon and armor proficiencies, and may use your gear if you lend it to them.

```
Creation
This artificial lifeform is of your design, cobbled together from body parts.
Huge Aberration
HP: 26(4d8+6)
AC: 12(tough hide)
Speed: 30ft
|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|
| 17| 12| 12| 16|  4| 10|
Attacks:
Slam +4 1d8+3 bludgeoning
```

#### We need to go back
You have learned time mechanics, albeit it's tricker than it looks. Expend 8 hit dice to open a portal in time, which can go as far back as a week. The portal remains open for one week, and once it closes, strands you in the past. Your party may follow you through the portal, but other creatures may as well for as long as the portal remains open.

#### Hang 10!
You have developed a board that hovers up to 15 feet off the ground, granting you a flying speed of 30ft. Flying past another creature does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

#### Now you're thinking with portals!
You have developed a 15lb gun which creates an orange or blue portal on smooth surfaces at least 5x5ft square. When both portals are deployed, one may pass into one and out the other, preserving momentum.

#### Life, uh, finds a way
You may now construct cloning vats, which require 500GP of materials each. Using a drop of blood, bone fragment, or other biological sample of a creature, you may now grow a clone of that creature. Aging can be accelerated up to ten times normal speed, and the clone may be held in stasis for up to 500 years before the power source of the cloning vats gives out. Once a clone is adult maturity, you may transfer a creature's memories to it, allowing you to use the clone as a replacement for yourself or another creature.

#### You're on a rampage!
You may now expend 20 stamina dice in order to transform. Your size becomes huge, and you have 50 hit points. Your speed is 50ft, you have a climbing speed of 30, and your unarmed attacks deal 3d8 bludgeoning damage. Your form resembles one of the following animals: ape, lizard, rat, rhino, crab, wolf. Refer to the lycanthrope's flowchart in order to determine how you behave. The keeper might request control during transformation. The form lasts up to 8 hours, or until you reach 0 hit points. When the transformation ends, you transform back to your normal form, naked and unconscious. For every 8 hours you spend unconscious, you regain one stamina die. During this time, you still lose stamina dice from skipping food or drink. Others may put you in a comfortable bed or give other amenities to you while you are out, speeding up your recovery.

## Prototype Weapons

#### Boxarockets
A 3x3 grid of rocket tubes fixed into a shoulder-mounted configuration. With your free hand, you hold a lit piece of match cord which you may ignite any of the rockets with. When you fire, pick a point and select a number of rockets to launch. Every creature within a 5 foot radius of the point must succeed a DC 15 dexterity saving throw to halve the damage of your attack, which is 1d4 fire damage per rocket. Reloading requires 10 minutes, and a box of rockets requires 10gp of materials. The boxarockets weighs 15lbs loaded, and 9 rockets weigh 3lb. Rockets can target up to 60 feet accurately.

#### Pneumatimusket
This isn't a real musket, as you're proficient with this one, and it weighs 20lb. This musket has an air tank located in it's stock, which is what propels the bullets it fires. This weapon is designed with an internal tube magazine and air tank to fire exactly twenty shots before it must be reloaded and pumped. Pumping takes 10 minutes and expends a stamina die, and 20 bullets requires 3gp of materials to craft. Each shot deals 1d6 piercing damage, and the pneumatimusket has a range of 80/120. When you use your action to fire the pneumatimusket, you may use your bonus action to fire it a second time.

#### Flamer

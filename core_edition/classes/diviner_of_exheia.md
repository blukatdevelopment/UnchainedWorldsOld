## Feats

### Divine spellcasting
You've learned to call upon the power of Exheia, who is concerned with little more than discovery. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability. Your spell DC (difficulty class) is 8+proficiency bonus + wisdom modifier. Your spellcasting modifier is proficiency bonus + wisdom modifier.

#### Your library
You locate or establish a library of Exheia with at least one full-time librarian. When you donate a novel artifact to the library, you gain 1 discovery. If you donate a novel book or scroll, you gain 1d4 discovery instead. If you donate a spellbook, you receive 1 discovery for each spell in it. You may likewise copy your spell tattoos onto paper to donate them.

#### Spell tattoos
Spell tattoos are conduits for Exheia's power that allow you to cast a single spell. They glow dimly in the dark. When you become a diviner, Exheia burns tattoos of three random cantrips. Every time you gain a level in this class, Exheia burns a tattoo of a random spell of the highest level available onto your arm. Every time you cast a spell, make a spell check against the DC indicated below. Failing causes the tattoo to stop glowing, preventing you from casting with it. You may consume one cumulative discovery to pray to Exheia to restore the tattoo to working order. The head librarian at your library may apply a spell tattoo to one of your arms if they have an artifact such as a spell scroll or spell book there to copy from. Doing so consumes 15gp of rune ink.

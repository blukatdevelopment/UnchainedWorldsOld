# Psion
Your mind extends beyond itself, an invisible appendage that allows you to reach farther than your arms, see farther than your eyes, and to peer into and trifle with the minds of others. There is no outward evidence of your difference, and it is unclear whether you will ever meet someone similarly-minded.

## Hit points
Roll 3d4 and add your CON modifier three times(minimum 1HP). These are your starting hit points. Every time you gain a level, you may roll again and keep the total if it is higher.

## Stamina Die size
The psion's stamina die is a d4.

## Features

### Invisible Hand
When you concentrate, you can can use your action to conjure force in the form of an invisible hand. This hand has a range of 30 feet and can lift no more  than 10lb. The hand can be active for up to one minute.

#### From higher levels
When cast as a first level spell, the range increases to 60 feet, it can carry 50lb, and you may attack with it to deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage. Wisdom is the ability used for melee attacks with your invisible hand. You are proficient with your invisible hand.

When cast as a second level spell, the hand can carry 100lb, grapple, shove, or drag creatures(make a spellcheck in lieu of athletics checks). Attack damage  increases to 1d6 bludgeoning and you can wield one-handed melee weapons with it.

When cast as a third level spell, the hand can carry 300lb, grapple or shove large creatures two sizes larger than you, and it deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage.

### Silent Voice
You focus on one creature within 120 feet of you and spend your action sending a message to it no longer than 6 seconds. The creature perceives this message in your language, and may reply with a message no longer than 6 seconds.

#### From higher levels
When cast as a first level spell, you may send your message to up to two creatures instead of one. The range increases to 240 feet.

When cast as a second level spell, you may send your message to up to three creatures instead of one, you communicate through solid objects.

### Psionic Guidance
You draw from your well of mental guidance to creatures within thirty feet of  you. Either as an action on your turn or as a reaction on another creature's turn, you may roll your psionic die as if casting a spell and add the number you rolled to a creature’s attack, ability check, skill check, or saving throw(including death saving throws).

### Spellcasting
You have awakened latent abilities. They will grow stronger as you grow further in tune with yourself. Your spellcasting ability is wisdom. To determine the limit of your magical capacity you use a psionic die. At first level, your psionic die is a D2. It increases in size according to the “psionic die” column in the psion table. Spells you cast never need verbal, somatic, nor material components. If you cast a damage-dealing spell and roll the maximum value on the first psionic die you roll for that spell, the spell deals critical damage.

#### Using the psionic die
When you cast a spell of first or higher level, you roll a number of dice equal to the spell’s level. If any of these dice roll a 1, your die decreases one  size. When you roll a 1 on a D2, you can no longer cast spells this way.

#### Spells Known
You know one 1st level spells, and learn one spell each time you gain a level in this class. When you gain a level in this class, you may swap out one spell with another of the same level.

### Meditation
When your psionic die's current size is D2 or higher, you may spend 10 minutes and one stamina die to increase its size by one. Your psionic die may not be larger than the maximum size for your level, indicated in the class table above.

### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

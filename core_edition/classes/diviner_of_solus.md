## Feats

### Divine Spellcasting
You've learned to call upon the power of a deity. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability. You learn two cantrips, and have access to any spell available to your level. Your spell DC (difficulty class) is 8+proficiency bonus + wisdom modifier. Your spellcasting modifier is proficiency bonus + wisdom modifier. See your deity's section for more spellcasting details.

### Solus
God of fire, war, light, swords, and the sun. Solus is often depicted as a flaming sword. Followers of Solus often speak of a day of flame, a hypothetical age when the world grows so evil that Solus returns to boil the oceans and glass the continents.

#### Code: Justice
Solus is organized around pushing back the darkness. Killing the undead, fiends, monstrosities, and enemies of the church award you 3d4 * 4 justice. Slaying one of these creatures that is large or larger instead awards 3d8 * 4 justice. Your spellcasting is fueled by your reserve of justice, with cost provided in the table below.

| Spell Level |  Justice |
|:------------|:---------|
| Cantrip     |        1 |
| 1           |        5 |
| 2           |       30 |
| 3           |      100 |
| 4           |      300 |
| 5           |      900 |

#### Channel Divinity: Flame of Solus
You are now proficient with shortswords, longswords, and greatswords. When you consume 5 justice to speak Solus's name and hold out your blade, it erupts with flames and deals an addition 2d8 radiant damage. It also casts 60 feet of bright. These effects last up to 8 hours. If you are killed while using this ability, your soul is captured inside the blade and you live on as a magical sword(+1 for levels 1-5, +2 for level 6-9, +3 for level 10). You may communicate telepathically with those who wield you.

## Feats

### Divine Spellcasting
You've learned to call upon the power of a deity. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability. You learn two cantrips Your spell DC (difficulty class) is 8+proficiency bonus + wisdom modifier. Your spellcasting modifier is proficiency bonus + wisdom modifier. See your deity's section for more spellcasting details.

#### Preparing Spells
Before you sleep at night, you may perform a prayer to bimros request a number of spells equal to half your diviner level (rounded down) plus your wisdom modifier,  minimum of one spell. You may select these spells from the  diviner spell list, and they must be first level or higher. You may only cast spells that you have prepared.

#### Piety
Bimros provides your source of magic, and so your fuel for spellcasting is piety. Your actions are judged, providing and revoking piety. If your balance of piety ever falls below zero, you lose all all divine spellcasting and magical abilities. You cannot cast a spell if you do not have enough piety to do so.

| Spell Level |  Piety Cost |
|:------------|:------------|
| Cantrip     |           1 |
| 1           |           5 |
| 2           |          30 |
| 3           |         100 |
| 4           |         300 |
| 5           |         900 |

#### The 14 laws
Legend says that his fourteen laws were written on a thousand foot monolith, though the location of it is unknown. The common translation of the laws are all that remains, and are highly disputed between different churches.
1. Pray to no other
2. Kill the murder
3. Steal the hand of the thief
4. Punish evil
5. Punish those who challenge the temple
6. Lust not outside of marriage
7. Pay at the temple, or burn sacrifices at the shrine
8. Wield no magic but mine
9. Neither speak nor read evil
10. Do not wear the color of demons(red)
11. Eat no gold thing
12. Build houses of three
13. Eat no flesh of man
14. Tell no lie
This translates to the following effect on piety.
| Action                |         Piety        |
|:----------------------|:---------------------|
| -Break the laws       |      -4d10 * 40      |
| +Burn large heart     |      +3d4  * 4       |
| +Enforce the laws     |      +3d4  * 4       |
| +Daily prayer(1 hour) |      +1d10           |
| +Donate 1gp to temple |      +1              |


### Channel divinity: Reap
You point to an unrepenting breaker of the laws of Bimros and hold your other hand in the air. A blue spectral scythe appears in your open hand with the crackle of thunder, consuming 30 piety. The blade remains for 1 minute and uses your WIS mod for attack and damage rolls. It deals 3d10 force damage. For every attack against the selected target, you gain piety equal to damage dealt. When the target dies, the scythe vanishes.

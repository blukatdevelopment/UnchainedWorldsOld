## Features

### Inventing
Over the course of an 8 hour work day, the inventor creates a blueprint which requires up to nine items that are combined to form a single item. Work with the keeper when you create blueprints. Blueprints are created with a DC from 5 to 25 based on the complexity used for crafting. Inventors may invent a number of new blueprints equal to their intelligence score + their level in inventor. Blueprints learned from others don't count against this limit.

### Crafting
Over the course of an 8 hour work day, the inventor attempts to create the blueprint. Make an INT check and add your proficiency bonus. If you succeed against the blueprint's DC, you successfully craft the item. If you fail, you may try again. If you roll a natural 1, the items used are destroyed in a dramatic mishap.

### Common knowledge
Your interest in inventing didn't come from a vacuum. Pick three of the following blueprints that got you started. You know them.

#### Sticky fuel
DC 9. Requires one flask of Insane Adhesive, one flask of oil. Once lit, the sticky fuel burns for a minute straight and cannot be extinguished with water. A creature covered in flaming sticky fuel takes 2d4 fire damage each turn.

#### Double-barreled crossbow
DC 15. Requires two crossbows(light, heavy, or hand). This crossbow weighs 50% more, rounded up to the nearest pound. You may use your action and bonus action to fire this crossbow twice in one turn, but must use an action to reload it's second bolt before using this ability again.

#### Pressure tank
DC 15. Requires an iron pot, a waterskin, and a scrap metal. Weighs 5lb and includes built-in hand pump. Can be pressurized with a gas or liquid, and closing the valve releases the contents in a strong stream.

#### Flameless Ration Heater
DC 10. Requires scrap metal, waterskin. One-time use item. Add water and the flameless ration heats up, allowing you to cook an iron ration and replace the need for fire in the "Fire and shelter" amenity.

#### Metal Cable
DC 15. Requires four units of scrap metal. Weighs 20lb, 50ft, can hold a 2000lb weight without snapping, resists cutting with blades, and conducts lightning.

#### Mana Sensor
DC 12. Requires one gem(worth at least 10gp), scrap metal, 1oz bottle of rune ink. Weighs 2lb. When within 5ft of a magic field, active spell, or magical effect, the sensor gem faintly glows. Handling the sensor bare hands causes a tingly sensation.

#### Flash powder(vial)
DC 12. Requires 8 units of scrap metal and a vial of acid. Flash powder instantly burns when lit, producing a bright flash that can be seen from a great distance as well as an incredible amount of heat. Direct eye contact with the flash requires a DC 15 CON save to avoid being blinded for a minute. Flash powder causes 1d8 fire damage if burned directly on a creature.

#### Spring battery
DC 12. Requires 8 units of scrap metal. This 3lb box can be wound up tightly. Pressing the release latch causes a gear to spin rapidly until the spring is unwound.

#### Auto-tinder
DC 12. Requires spring battery, scrap metal. When triggered, produces a series of sparks sufficient to light flammable materials. Requires winding.

#### Timed trigger
DC 12. Requires spring battery, 2 units of scap metal. Turning the dial on this device causes it to begin ticking, counting up to 5 minutes in 6-second increments. When the timer runs out, it chimes and either pushes or pulls on an attached device such as a crossbow trigger. Requires winding.

### Field of Expertise
Choose one skill you're proficient with. You now have advantage on checks using it. This might help you complete  blueprints using this skill, or to analyze the chemical/alchemical/physical properties of a new object or substance.

### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

### Economy of scale
When you have sufficient materials, you may attempt to craft multiple of the same item over the course of 8 hours. The DC rises by 5 for two items, 8 for three, and 10 for four. If the crafting check is successful, all items are made at once. Otherwise, none of the items are made.

### Depth or Breadth
Choose depth or breadth of your research. If you choose depth, you gain a +5 bonus to all crafting recipes. If you choose breadth, you can invent an additional two blueprints per level.

### Signature Blueprint
Choose one blueprint. When you craft with it, you gain a +10 bonus and cannot critically fail the check.

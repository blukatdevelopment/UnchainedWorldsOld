### Uaos
God of agriculture, Uaos created beast folk in his image to live in harmony with the world. He is depicted as a giant bullfolk wielding a spear with a horn on the tip. In response to Bimros's 14 laws, Uaos privately distributed hundreds of fables containing conflicting morals to different worshippers in different corners of the world. These are referred to as "the lessons", and are not intended to be taken at face value, but to instead portray morality as a self-driven process that cannot be enforced from without.

#### Code: Conviction
To become a diviner of Uaos, you must define their own moral code as six virtues. The head of a temple of UAS then and tattoos the virtues onto your back. During a rest, you may pray to Uaos to prepare a spell for each virtue. Whenever you cast a spell, make a spell check with your spell check using the table below to determine the DC. Failing this check causes the tattoo to vanish and the spell to become unavailable. By performing an act to further your virtue that satisfies Uaos, the tattoo reappears and the spell becomes available to cast again.

|Spell Level|DC|
|:----------|:-|
| Cantrip   | 8|
|       1st |10|
|       2nd |12|
|       3rd |14|
|       4th |16|

## Features

### Spellcasting
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability. Your spellcasting modifier is your STR modifier + your proficiency bonus. Your spellcasting DC is 8 + your STR modifier + your proficiency bonus. Your magic is shaped by speaking magically potent words. One who commands fire, for instance, may conjure a flame hovering over their palm, ignite a candle across the room, change the color or shape of a flame, or erupt a cone of flame against multiple creatures.  The player describes what they wish to do with their word, then the keeper assigns a cost in stamina dice to attempt it as well as the DC for a spellcasting check in order to succeed. A failed spell fizzles out while still consuming stamina dice.

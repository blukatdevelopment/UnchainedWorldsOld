## Features

### Magic word spellcasting
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability. Your spellcasting modifier is your STR modifier + your proficiency bonus. Your spellcasting DC is 8 + your STR modifier + your proficiency bonus. Your magic is shaped by speaking magically potent words. One who commands fire, for instance, may conjure a flame hovering over their palm, ignite a candle across the room, change the color or shape of a flame, or erupt a cone of flame against multiple creatures.  The player describes what they wish to do with their word, then the keeper assigns a cost in stamina dice to attempt it as well as the DC for a spellcasting check in order to succeed. A failed spell fizzles out while still consuming stamina dice.

#### Magic Words known
At level 1, you know 1 magic word. Roll it from the Magic Words table. Each time you gain a level in Wizard, roll one new more magic word to learn.

### Two word spells
You may create a spell using two words. For example, `fire` `sight` may involve seeing heat for a duration. Though this spell may be accomplished using only the word `sight`, it grows stronger with a second word. Two word spells consume one less stamina die(minimum 0) when cast, and you gains a +2 bonus to the spellcheck.

### Three word spells
You may create a spell using three words. Three word spells consume two less stamina dice(minimum 0) when cast, and you gain a +4 bonus to the spellcheck.

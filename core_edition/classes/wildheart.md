## Feats

### Nature Spirit
You begin your career as a wildheart by befriending one powerful nature spirit. The spirit takes the form of an animal and controls a specific domain. Choose from below to determine your spirit animal and domain.

#### Eagle of grasslands
You gain proficiency in perception, and advantage on perception checks which rely on sight.

#### Elk of the forest
Pointed antlers sprout from your head, and may be used as a natural weapon that deals 1d6+STR piercing damage. When your natural weapon attack hits a creature, you may expend a stamina die to add 2d8 extra damage to it.

#### Wolf of the hills
(Optional)You sprout the ears and tail of a wolf. You are proficient in perception, and you have advantage on perception checks that rely on your heightened sense of smell.

#### Brown bear of the caves
(Optional)The ears and stubby tail of a brown bear sprout on your body. When you use your action to make an attack, you may expend a stamina die to make one additional attack. You may only use this ability once per turn.

#### Ram of the mountains
Ram horns sprout from your head and can be used as a natural weapon that deals 1d6+STR damage. When you move 20ft in a straight line before making an attack with these horns, the attack deals an additional 1d12 damage, and the target must succeed a CON saving throw or lose their reaction until the start of their next turn. The DC for the saveing throw is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your strength.

#### Alligator of the river
(Optional)Your skin becomes scaly and resistant to water damage, and you grow the tail of an alligator. You gain a swimming speed of 30ft and may hold your breath for one hour before you need to take another breath.

#### Fennec Fox of the sands
(Optional)You sprout fox ears and a fox tail. When moving, you may expend a stamina die in order to not provoke attacks of opportunity for the remainder of your turn. You are immune to the ill-effects of exposure to hot or dry weather.

### Minor Wildshape
You may use an action to expend a stamina die and reshape your body into a tiny size beast such as a frog, bat, cat, hawk, snake, spider, trout, or mouse. Whichever beast you select, it uses the stat block below. When you enter your wildshape, your gear falls about you on the ground and if you are grappled, that grapple ends. If your hit points falls below 1, you change back into your normal form with up to half your hit points. If you are inside a space that cannot accomodate your normal form, you receive 3d10 shunting damage and are teleported to an unoccupied space nearby. Your normal form retains the hit points it had before you wildshaped, even if your wildshaped form was brought down to negative hit points. You may exit your wildshape as an action by expending one stamina die.

### Spiritual Ascension
You outgrow the need for your nature spirit and learn to cast spells without it's blessing. You gain one of the following benefits:

#### Wild Spirit
When you die, your soul may attempt to enter the body of a creature within 30ft of your body. The creature must succeed a WIS save, or else swap bodies with you just before your final breath. A creature may willingly fail this save. If the creature succeeds, you may attempt this with each other creature within 30ft of your body. If all creatures within range resist this bodyswap, you are dead. If you succeed in switching bodies, you inherit their physical form, including their STR, DEX, and CON scores, but retain your mental abilities and wildheart powers.

#### Reincarnation
When you die, your soul is transferred to a beast that has just been born. You may expend 5 stamina dice to assume your avatar form, the form you had when you first gained a level in wildheart. Falling below 1 HP reverts you from your avatar form. You retain your memories, all levels of wildheart, and mental ability scores in your beast form, but you may only cast spells in your avatar form. If you die as a beast, you are reincarnated again. If you die in your avatar form, your death is permanent.

#### Nature Spirit
When you die, you become a nature spirit. You gain a fly speed of 30ft, are immune to non-magical piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage, and no longer need to eat, sleep or breathe. If this form is destroyed, you are dead.

#### Enduring Spirit
When you die, you may make a single d20 roll. On a 5 or higher, you wake with 1 hit point instead of dying. Next time you make this save, your roll has a -1 penalty, which grows by 1 each time you make this save afterwards.

#### Youthful Spirit
You stop aging and are immune to death by old age. Instead, you live until something other than old age kills you.

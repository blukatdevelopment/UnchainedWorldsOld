## Feats

### Divine Spellcasting
You've learned to call upon the power of Kord, goddess of sleep, ice, stone, and circles. She is depicted as a teal-skinned, pointy-eared humanoid with white irises and hair who leaves icy footsteps as she walks. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability. Your spell DC (difficulty class) is 8+proficiency bonus + wisdom modifier. Your spellcasting modifier is proficiency bonus + wisdom modifier. See your deity's section for more spellcasting details.

### Spell tattoos
At first level, select four cantrips, which are burned onto your neck or collar area as white rune tattoos. Each time you gain a level in this class, you learn an additional spell that kord burns onto you as a tattoo. The tattoos glow in the dark and are cold to the touch. When you cast a spell, make a spellcheck against the appropriate DC listed below. Failing the spellcheck causes the spell's tattoo to stop glowing and become exhausted. When you pray at an altar of Kord with at least one full-time priest or priestess, all your spell tattoos are restored.

### Channel divinity: Kord's Armory

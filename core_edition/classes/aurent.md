## Features

### Aura
You are capable of ducking, dodging, redirecting, and absorbing many attacks made at you. The energy used to perform this evasion is known as aura. You may replenish your aura by using your bonus action to expend a stamina die. When you do, roll all of your aura dice. You may either take the amount rolled, or instead keep the amount of aura you already have.

### Aura Fists
Your unarmed attacks deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage and are considered light and flexible weapons. They are considered magical weapons for the purpose of overcoming resistance to non-magical attacks.

### Techniques
You know three techniques and may learn one more with each level. Most techniques consume aura to work. If you attempt to use a technique and it consumes more aura than you have, the difference is subtracted from your hit points. If this brings you below 1 hit point, you are down only after the technique is executed.

### Discipline

#### Radiant Order
Your discipline started with the oath of silence and harsh martial arts training, but the true test began when you came of age and learned of your greater purpose.

Given one minute, it can cut a door through as much as a foot of steel. The blade only works for those who know the Radiant Order.

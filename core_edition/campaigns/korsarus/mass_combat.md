# Mass Combat
Here are rules that can be used to simulate wars and resolve battles.

## Units
Each unit represents a group of combatants of one faction. Each has a pool of dice representing it's strength called it's power pool. A unit has HP, which at most may be equal to the maximum value of the dice in its power pool. The a unit's roll on a power pool may never exceed the unit's current HP.

### Examples of power pools
1d4 may represent an angry mob of commoners, a hunting party, a small group of militia, or similar. 1d6, 1d8, and 1d12 would represent small groups with escalating firepower. When a group has more soldiers, doubling or trippling the number of dice makes sense. For monsters and very powerful mages, a doubling or trippling dice is likewise reasonable. For instance, a single giant might easily plow through the rank of a small army, and the same is true for a fireball-wielding mage.

## Battles
During a battle, two sides sharing a hex, or on adjacent hexes, fight. Each side has a minimum of one unit.

### power rolls
Each unit targets one other. Once targets are assigned, assign any bonuses that seem appropriate to each unit. Roll all power pools simultaneously. For every unit, combine the total of all rolls targeting it and subtract that number from the unit's HP. If the unit falls below 1 HP, it is destroyed. If a unit survives and it's power roll is less than the total of power rolls targeting it, the unit retreats in the opposite direction of it's enemies at the end of the battle.

#### Common modifiers
| Mod | Cause                 |
|:----|:----------------------|
|  +2 | High ground           |
|  +3 | surprise              |
|  +1 | Defending town        |
|  +3 | Fortifications        |
|  +3 | friendly locals       |
|  -3 | unfriendly locals     |
|  -3 | cut off from supplies |
|  -3 | Exposed to elements   |

### Restoring and creating units
Restoring units requires access to appropriate personnel, weapons, and equipment. A unit restores 1 HP per day it remains idle in a location meeting these requirements. In such a location, a new unit may be created, gaining 1 HP each day of it's recruitment. There may be circumstances where more HP can beganed per day, such as when a large amount of resources are allocated at once towards recruitment and equopment.

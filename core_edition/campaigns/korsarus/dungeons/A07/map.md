## Infernoid
Once a humanoid makes a pact for infernal power, they can't go back. The infernal power corrupts, and the contract binds. With each new contract, the humanoid signs over a little more of their humanity. These contracts are most-often negotated at time of death.

1. Devil's eyes: See in regular and magical darkness 120ft
2. Devil's tongue: cast charm person on command.
3. Devil's Wings: Fly speed of 30ft 
4. Mark of Infernal fortitude(bonus action, 1/day): Gain 3d12 temporary hit points

## Vice
This soul rests on the razor's edge between the abyssal and infernal planes, but ultimately is created as a devil by accepting an infernal pact. A vice is the lawful embodiment of a particular deadly sin, and embraces that sin in an intentional fashion.

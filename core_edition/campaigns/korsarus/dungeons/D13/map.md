## Pincer Beast
This hard-shelled bipedal creature resembles a crab. It has a hunchback and no clear separation between head and torso. It has two crab-like claws that can scissor through some steels. It's chitonous shell is a premium building material in the tunnels for it's durability, treasured as much for it's utility as for it's scarcity, due to the ferocity of these monsters. Pincer lack eyes and ears, but each has two antennae that resemble the end of a stalk of wheat with many tiny hairs that listen for vibrations of sound.

## Flesh Eaters
Once humanoids, but corrupted into monsters. Their minds are warped to feel no remorse, and to crave uncorrupted humanoid flesh. If one consumes the flesh of a flesh eater, they become corrupted and themself become a flesh eater. Flesh eaters seek safety in numbers, expanding their populations by force-feeding captured humanoids pieces of themselves. Their regenerative powers grow back flesh and limbs missing from them, but without skin. Instead of blood, flesh eaters ooze a black fluid.

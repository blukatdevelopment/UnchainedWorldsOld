Sentinel + Giant Leech

## Sentinel
A partially biological weapon that outlived it's use in the Titan wars. This creature has an organic body resembling a werewolf, with their face, torso, hips and claw tips replaced with lost tech mechanical components. Their face visor displays a glowing image of their face, and opens to allow them to eat. Some Sentinels have overcome their original programming, but most in the wild are still seeking out and killing any armed humanoids they encounter. The Sentinel will not attack humanoids that are unarmed, or who discard their weapons. They will confiscate discarded weapons and destroy them, however. Their organic portions can be regenerated from the mechanical portions.

1. Spear with bloody fingerprints
2. Rusty Light Crossbow, 10 bolts (Shared with an NPC)

# Boon Starters
Checklist to say to players:

0. You are playing your backstory. It is a game you can win and lose. Survival and escape are victory. Death is defeat.
1. Do what you need to win. There is no one path to victory. There are many paths to defeat.
2. You can and will die depending on decisions and dice. If you do, you can make a normal character.
3. You are unlikely to win by your stat block alone. Be calculating, takes risks, and be ruthless.


## Test Subjects
Each player has three commoners(field folk). Commoners gain their power(1d10 or 1d20 table) when they reach 1 or fewer hit points the first time, or are rendered unconscious. Players start with their memories wiped in underground facility near Arcanus. They must escape to survive.

## University
Each player has one student(gold robe). Students go through their student life, getting chances to learn some cantrips(cast with stamina die) or leveled spells(2 * spell level stamina dice per cast) depending on checks and challenges. At some point, it's revealed that all the students have lost their family due to a cultist attack on a feast. The killer leaves behind/graffitis a list of their names. They can either catch the killer, die, or run.

## Gladiator
Give players each an executee. Have them fight a relatively strong monster and all die(be merciless). Now start the actual scenario. Now give each player a commoner locked into the arena(roll for their crime/debt). They have 3 days to train before they fight the same monster again. There are five mentors(swordsman, battle mage, monk, archer, assassin). Each day, the PCs must choose a different mentor to train under. Their performance (skill checks and otherwise) earn them points of progression toward earning boons in that domain. A thief with a broken leg explains to one of them that it's impossible to beat the monster, and that escaping through a secret tunnel is the only way to survive. He offers this in exchange for promising to rescue him or pay for his escape later.

## Academy
The players each get three commoners. They run them through training, getting stat increases, proficiencies according to how well they perform some checks and challenges. Then they're all sent to wipe out a camp of bandits or giant and report back with evidence of their success.

## Prison Break: Thieves' Guild
Each player gets a prisoner to play as. The grey fox (fox folk) visits them in the courtyard and outside their windows to prepare them for their escape. A couple chances to raise their dexterity and strength. On a specific day, they follow his instructions and get smuggled out of prison. Once they are out, the grey fox informs them that guards are already looking for them, but he's willing to grease some palms and call off the search if they steal a trinket from a wealthy person's home and bring it to a drop spot. He, of course, is testing them for admission into the thieves' guild.

## Warrior Training
Each player gets two red-eyed children. The Hellknight Wrath teaches them to survive in the tunnels and learn to fight monsters. The Hellknight will probably lead the group on hunts, make them fight to the death, etc, and whittle them down to one replacement.

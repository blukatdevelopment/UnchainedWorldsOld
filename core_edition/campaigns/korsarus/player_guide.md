# Quickstart Guide
## What kind of campaign is this?

### Survival horror meets D&D
Monsters are scary. Traps are deadly. Survival is the fruit of paying attention to your environment, stacking advantages, and protecting yourself. 

### Open World
See that mountain? You can climb it! There's no invisible walls. Feel free to go off the beaten path. Just know that it'll take me a sec to improv the interior of a random house you're burglarizing.

### Don't write a backstory, play it!
- Pick a culture, an old profession, and a personality trait
- Lean into the drama of survival
- Hard decisions define the character
- Your bonds are the friends you make along the way

### Player-driven sessions
Your first session or two will turn a commoner into a proper adventurer. After that? Well, you'll want to connect with other players and scheme up some plans. Maybe you want to delve a dungeon, or overthrow a king, pull off a heist, or answer one of the quest ads. Are your characters unavailable or way more powerful than the rest of the party? Roll a new one for the next session.

### Play-by-post downtime
When your characters aren't out on an adventure, there's more opportunities to play. There are channels that represent the cities in the world. What can you do in them?
- Roleplay with other PCs to socialize, build alliances, and organize player-created quests
- Roleplay with NPCs to get quests or participate in domain-level play
- Declare a downtime activity(mechanics can improvised by the keeper)
- Do solo or small group play as play-by-post to do stuff that wouldn't make sense with a group of 4 people in a voice call

## Your first character
Your first character starts as a Commoner from the Soot culture. This will get you into the action quickly. As you interact with the world, you'll unlock new classes, cultures, and other character options. When you unlock your first class, you may immediately give them a level in this class and update their ability scores using the rules described in the `Your other characters` section.

### Your Appearance
Your appearance can be your choice of human or beast folk, as described below.

#### Humans
Humans are the most common humanoid by far, and they vary heavily. While some humans stand eight feet in height, and others stand under four, it's most common for humans to stand between five and six feet tall. Rarely, humans have elongated ears, or those of a beast coupled with a similar tail. The most common complexion for human ranges from pink, yellow, tan, and brown. Green, blue, and crimson skin is exotic, but not unheard of. Humans were originally created by the god Bimros in an attempt to populate the world with worshippers.

#### Beast folk
Beast folk have a vaguely humanoid frame, but their features are that of beasts. Fur, scales, feathers, and leathery hides are the norm for beast folk. They were originally the creation of the god Uaos, who envied the creation of humans and wanted his own worshippers.

### Your backstory
You were born and raised in the filthy slums of the copper ring of Korsarus City. Whether your old life involved shoveling manure, begging on the street, or picking pockets, one truth remains. You've got nothing to show for that life, and nothing to lose by abandoning it for a life of adventuring. For the first time in your life, you are ready to plunge head-first into danger, even if it means abandoning the protection of Korsarus's outer-most walls.

### Your stat block
To get you started quickly, don't worry about building a stat block. You'll be playing as a commoner, and all that stuff will be worked out as you go.

## Your other characters
After you've made your first character, you'll generate ability scores, choose a culture, and then choose a class.

### Ability Scores
You get a choice. You can either use the standard array, or roll scores.

#### Standard Array
This is the consistent option that works well if you know what class you'd like to pick, as you'll have the same values to work with. `[15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]` You may assign these ability scores in your preferred order.

#### Roll Scores
Get ready to discover your character! Use rodbot's `!roll stats`

### Pick a culture
Select a culture, either Soot, or another you have unlocked. You will be provided a link to the document for each ci;tire you unlock.

### Pick a class
Select a class, either Commoner, or another you have unlocked. You will be provided a link to the document for each class you unlock.

### Create your stat block with the Blubot character page
You can enter your character details. The page will generate a blob of JSON for you. You can feed this to Blubot using the `/character update` command.

### Character thread
Add a comment to `#characters` with your character name. Then create a thread for them and post your stat block in it. If you're rolling ability scores, do it there with the `.roll abilities` command using rodbot. Your inventory, NPC connections, resource stashes, etc can all be listed here along with any character art or important character updates. This can be fun to look back on and remember your characters by when the campaign ends.

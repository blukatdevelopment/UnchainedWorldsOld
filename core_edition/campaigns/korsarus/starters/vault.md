# Vault
The vault was a titan installation set up during the titan era to survive in the event of a war of mass destruction.

## Scenario prompts
Rolling on the following sections will shape up the vault the party starts in.

### Critical failure
The rising action which precipitates some disaster

1. Broken water chip
2. Power source running low on fuel
3. Wild magic corruption leak
4. Food synthesizer malfunctioning

### Overseer
Power is concentrated into one leader who oversees the 

1. Sahcha(Sahchaoreeshai): Psionic supremecist. Mandatory psionic experiments and testing(1/6 chance of having gift).
2. Maytcheu(Maytcheuteuzih): Obsessed with beating opponent Waypeo (Waypeovaokah) in the next election. Bread and circuses, NIMBY, securing largest demographics.
3. Kuhjoo(Kuhjoogihvee): Random and overwhelmed dweller selected by monthly lottery.
4. Toojeo(Toojeoshahkay): maintaining power by winning fights to the death. Vibes: D4[death metal, chivalry, scientific, death cult]
5. Hooteh(Hootehvahpeu): Transhumanist obsessed with augmentations. Each person roll d10[arm, leg, eye, heart, jaw, liver, hand, foot, ears, both eyes]
6. Cheeree(Cheereesaisao): Isolationist. Obsessed with keeping people from leaving the vault.

### Prevailing myth
The explanation of how the vault and the vault dwellers came to be passed on from the last generation.

1. The titans grew insane and cultivated mushrooms which drained the life from the surface world. The mushrooms withered and died, leaving the world a desert.
2. The titans designated the vault dwellers their chosen people, then cleansed the rest of the wicked world with holy fire.
3. The titans took the chosen ones to a new kingdom. The dying world is now inhabited solely by the damned.
4. V.A.U.L.T. a long-forgotten acronym. This installation is a satellite in orbit of Crucible.

### Recreation commons
Something keeps the people preoccupied, and it shapes the people that stay away from it as much as those who indulge in it.

1. Oasis virtual world. Reflects a bustling titan city before the titanfall. All infants are plugged in and raised inside until adolescence. Oasis time is currency.
2. Danger deck. Holodeck used to create tangible holograms. Used exclusively for battle simulations. Safety protocols disabled for high stakes training and competitions. Matters are resolved by contest without currency.
3. Gambling hall. Ration tokens are currency. Just about everything is gambled for. High quality items are rented from the overseer, rather than outright owned.
4. Gardens. A quarter mile diameter dome made to simulate an ideal summer's day. There are flowers, fresh grown produce, a small stream, bee hives, chickens, and a herd of pampered cows.

## Discover your PCs
Roll a question for each player and have them answer it. Each other player can ask one followup question to be answered. Once all players have done this, they should have an idea of their character.

1. You and the overseer are close. Why?
2. Name a superstitious vault rumor. Do you believe it?
3. What is your crowning achievement?
4. What blunder earned you a nickname around the vault?
5. Select another PC at random. You have a history with them. Describe it.
6. Explain your near-death experience and the phobia arising from it.
7. Describe the achievement that made you famous in the vault.
8. What do you know that you're not supposed to?
9. Explain how one of the other PCs saved your life.
10. Explain your rivalry with one of the other PCs.
11. What have you been denied in your life in the vault?
12. What do you actually believe is out there outside the vault?

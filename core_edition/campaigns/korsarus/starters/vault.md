# Vault
The vault was a titan installation set up during the titan era to survive in the event of a war of mass destruction.

## Scenario prompts
Rolling on the following sections will shape up the vault the party starts in.

### Critical failure
The rising action which precipitates some disaster

1. Broken water chip
2. Power source running low on fuel
3. Wild magic corruption leak
4. Food synthesizer malfunctioning

### Overseer
Power is concentrated into one leader who oversees the 

1. Sahcha(Sahchaoreeshai): Psionic supremecist. Mandatory psionic experiments and testing(1/6 chance of having gift).
2. Maytcheu(Maytcheuteuzih): Obsessed with beating opponent Waypeo (Waypeovaokah) in the next election. Bread and circuses, NIMBY, securing largest demographics.
3. Kuhjoo(Kuhjoogihvee): Random and overwhelmed dweller selected by monthly lottery.
4. Toojeo(Toojeoshahkay): maintaining power by winning fights to the death. Vibes: D4[death metal, chivalry, scientific, death cult]
5. Hooteh(Hootehvahpeu): Transhumanist obsessed with augmentations. Each person roll d10[arm, leg, eye, heart, jaw, liver, hand, foot, ears, both eyes]
6. Cheeree(Cheereesaisao): Isolationist. Obsessed with keeping people from leaving the vault.

### Prevailing myth
The explanation of how the vault and the vault dwellers came to be passed on from the last generation.

1. The titans grew insane and cultivated mushrooms which drained the life from the surface world. The mushrooms withered and died, leaving the world a desert.
2. The titans designated the vault dwellers their chosen people, then cleansed the rest of the wicked world with holy fire.
3. The titans took the chosen ones to a new kingdom. The dying world is now inhabited solely by the damned.
4. V.A.U.L.T. a long-forgotten acronym. This installation is a satellite in orbit of Crucible.

### Recreation commons
Something keeps the people preoccupied, and it shapes the people that stay away from it as much as those who indulge in it.

1. Oasis virtual world. Reflects a bustling titan city before the titanfall. All infants are plugged in and raised inside until adolescence. Oasis time is currency.
2. Danger deck. Holodeck used to create tangible holograms. Used exclusively for battle simulations. Safety protocols disabled for high stakes training and competitions. Matters are resolved by contest without currency.
3. Gambling hall. Ration tokens are currency. Just about everything is gambled for. High quality items are rented from the overseer, rather than outright owned.
4. Gardens. A quarter mile diameter dome made to simulate an ideal summer's day. There are flowers, fresh grown produce, a small stream, bee hives, chickens, and a herd of pampered cows.

## Discover your PCs
Roll a question for each player and have them answer it. Each other player can ask one followup question to be answered. Once all players have done this, they should have an idea of their character.

1. You and the overseer are close. Why?
2. Name a superstitious vault rumor. Do you believe it?
3. What is your crowning achievement?
4. What blunder earned you a nickname around the vault?
5. Select another PC at random. You have a history with them. Describe it.
6. Explain your near-death experience and the phobia arising from it.
7. Describe the achievement that made you famous in the vault.
8. What do you know that you're not supposed to?
9. Explain how one of the other PCs saved your life.
10. Explain your rivalry with one of the other PCs.
11. What have you been denied in your life in the vault?
12. What do you actually believe is out there outside the vault?

## Facility

### Recreation commons
Center of the entire facility. The rec commons are connected on all cardinal directions to blocks.

### Blocks
Each block's public rooms are listed below. Some may be repurposed or altered to fit a vault's culture.
1. Housing
2. Mess Hall
3. Security
4. Sanitation(showers, toilets, laundry, hair cutter)
5. Medical bay
6. Industry(commissary, textiles, repair work, storage)

### Critical rooms
There are a few rooms of strategic importance.
- Overseer's office
- Waterworks
- Ventilation control
- Food fabrication
- Lift to surface
For each of these, roll which block D4[North, South, East, West] and a D6 for which of the rooms within the block this critical room is connected to. Some overseers may restrict access to these rooms with locking doors, stationed guards, or hidden doors.

## Name generator
Coarse Titan names are simple identification numbers akin to barcodes. It's common that vault dwellers will shorten, stylize, or completely replace their assigned names with nicknames. There are 255 characters in coarse titan, and each name has four characters.

For each character:
- roll a 1d6 for the column
- For the row, roll a 1d4 for the tens place and 1d10 for the ones place(a roll of 10 results in a 0).
- If using a dice bot, you can roll 1d6+1d4+1d10 to get these three values
- Reroll if need be.
- Decide a shortened version or nickname used on a daily basis.

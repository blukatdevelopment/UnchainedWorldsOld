# Giants
Giants were descended from typical humanoids, having eaten of or been exposed to the marrow of the divines. A powerful magic runs through them, granting them, among other things, a size and density of skeleton unmatched by similarly sized creatures. A crystal forms in their nape, providing them with power and likewise creating a weak point for them.

## Dwarf Giant
The smallest of giants are still formidable in combat, retaining many of the fine motor skills and tactis that are common among humanoids. They seldom travel alone, providing most of the fine motor skills for other giants. They are likely to ride on mounts such as moose or direwolves.

- Nape: Targeting the nape adds +5 to the AC. Hitting the nape deals double maximum damage.
- Giant's fortitude: If a giant's nape remains intact one minute after their death, they get back up with 1d8 HP

## Field Giant
The most common giant found in fields and prairies, taken in quite frequently as protectors by field folk.

## Red Giant
Like field giants, except found mostly in volcanic regions. Their hair is a bright fiery red, their skin a pink shade. Typically stand 45 feet tall.
`Red Giant, Size: Gargantuan, HP: 135(9d12+27), AC: 12, Speed: 40ft, [20,16, 16, 6, 12, 4], Greatclub +6 3d8 bludgeoning`

## Green Giant

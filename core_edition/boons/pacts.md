# Pacts
A pact is a magical agreement made with a powerful entity known as a patron. In exchange for doing the patron's bidding, they offer magical powers.

## Docla
Powered by the starvation of humanoids in the material plane, Docla wants to maximize and perpetuate starvation, and sends imps to offer pacts to power-hungry creatures.

### Pact of Docla I: Fasting Magic
A new pact-swearer gains spellcasting. They may use each spell once. They must either fast for one 24-hour day, or cause another creature fast in their place to regain use of these spells. The spellcasting ability is CHA, with the spell DC being 8 + proficiency bonus + CHA and the spell modifier being proficiency bonus + CHA.
- Death ward (1st)
- Ray of Sickness (1st)
- Weakening Hex (1st)

### Pact of Docla II: Starvation Magic
After causing a significant starvation event such as a crop failure or prolongued seige of a city, the following spells become available for use, appearing as infernal runes tattooed on your flesh. Each spell can be cast one time. All uses return if another significant starvation event is caused.
- Darkness (2nd)
- Silence (2nd)
- Wither (2nd)
- Phantom Steed (3rd)
- Life Transference (3rd)
- Petrification (3rd)

### Pact of Docla III: Famine Knight
If pact holder foregoes eating until they reach 0 hit points, Docla turns them into a famine knight. Their form remains permanently immaciated, gripped with hunger pains, and the following changes take place:
- STR and CON scores reduces by 2 each
- Their maximum stamina dice drops by 2
- No longer need to eat or drink water to survive
- Necrotic damage heals you
- As an action, you may consume a stamina die to touch a creature and deal 3d10 necrotic damage to them.
- As an action, you may consume five stamina dice to create a 120ft radius cloud of pestulance. All food and plants in this cloud wither and turn rancid as if having rapidly aged. All creatures in the cloud must succeed a DC 12 CON save to halve 1d12 necrotic damage.

### 100 Instant Catastrophic Death
Roll for a random, catastrophic instant death.

#### 1 Head Explode
Your head explodes. Fireball is cast centered inside your head.

#### 2 Hornets
Your entire biomass is converted into angry hornets that sting everyone within
60 feet for 1 minute, dealing 3d6 poison damage each turn spent in range.

#### 3 Void
You create a tear in the fabric of space inside your head. Everyone within 100 
feet must succeed a DC 16 STR save to hold onto a sturdy object or be pulled 20
feet towards the void. The void lasts a minute, and getting pulled into it is 
instant death.

#### 4 Time Travel
You and up to 2 creatures within 15 feet travel to the conditions just before 
the universe was formed. Your death during the big bang frees your soul, which 
becomes part of the seed that created the gods.

#### 5 Nuclear reaction
Everything within a 1 mile radius is vaporised as a mushroom cloud rises up and
the land in the radius is tainted with radiant energy, dealing 1d4 radiant
damage to any creature that stays in the land for 1 minute.

#### 6 Acid Explosion
You explode and spray acid in a 30ft radius. All creatures must succeed a DC 15
DEX save to halve 4d6 acid damage.

#### 7 Ice Storm
Everything within a 1 mile radius is frozen solid, and a blizzard rages until
someone destroys your icy heart.

#### 8 Tree of life
A tree sprouts from you and rises until it extends 1 mile into the air, it's roots expanding into vast networks underground. If you are inside a structure,
it collapses and every creature inside takes 10d8 bludgeoning damage.

## Diseases
When a character is created with a negative constitution modifier, it is often
because they have a disease. If not cured, the diseases will degrade their
health and they may die as a result. Once cured, a the previously diseased
adventurer's constition is raised to 10.

### Bogrot
Often caught from handling unclean frogs or swimming in raw sewage, bogrot
appears as black necrotic boils that burst to leave craters in the flesh.
The infected is vulnerable to necrotic damage. After having bogrot once, you
are immune from catching it again. If a healthy character catches bogrot, their
maximum hit points drops by 1d4 until they are cured.

### Ink Lung
Often caught from exposure to land squid ink and or magically-enriched coal,
ink lung causes the infected to cough small clouds of black ink dust.
If the infected uses the dash action, they must succeed a DC 15 con save or
enter a coughing fit, which consumes their reaction.

### Chicken Kisser's Lament
The only documented account of kisser's lament was a man who kissed a chicken
eel on the beak. However, he was torn in half when found, so a direct cure
is not known. Symptoms include growing a ring of white feathers around one's
lips. When the infected hear a loud noise, they must succeed a DC 16 wisdom
saving throw or use their reaction to move their entire movement in the opposite
direction of the noise.

### Angry Boils
It's difficult to say how many have been infected with anger boils, as
a diagnosis requires making patients angry. The infected will grow large red
boils on their face when frustrated or angry. After one hour, the boils recede
and the infected no longer shows symptoms as long as they remain calm. When the
boils surface, the character must succeed a DC 12 CON save or take 1d4 necrotic
damage. If the boils are cleansed with a flask of holy water or a DC 17 medicine
check using an herbalism kit, they are cured.

### Elf's Itch
The infected's ears grow inflamed and red, and itch intensely. When not treated
with a calming salve, the infected has disadvantage on ability checks. The salve
must be applied every four hours. Every night, the infected may make a DC 16 CON
save for their immune system to fight off the infection. Elves make this check
with disadvantage.

### Sneeze Itis
The infected experience a runny nose, nasal congestion, and frequent bouts
of sneezing. When exposed to strong smells, animal dander, pollen, or dust,
the infected must succeed a DC 15 con save or enter a sneezing fit for 6
seconds.

### Mouthfoam
The infection is transferred by the bite from an infected animal. The infected 
starts with one level of mouthfoam, and at the end of each day must succeed a 
DC 15 CON save to avoid gaining another level. There is no known non-magical
cure for mouthfoam.

# Dungeon Crawling Rules
1. Each square is 10ft
2. Rate rest safety 1-5. Roll to avoid monsters against that DC.
3. During combat encounter, improv some furniture/scenery to keep battlemaps from being killboxes
4. Take notes of which rooms have been cleared. Save for future delves.

## Procedure

0. Create description of room. Square=10ft, check adjacencies. Only then check for box text.
1. Ask for actions
2. Advance time 10 minutes
3. Roll 1d6, 1 is an encounter
4. Use physical paper clock to track torches, time of day, etc.
5. Rinse and repeat

## Generating dungeons
Create a wandering monster table, mishap table. (so you can switch between them on a 1 for encounters)

0. Write theme info on dungeon image, if possible
1. Keep 1/3 rooms "Empty" to show off dungeon theme, eat resources, build suspense (black text)
2. Make some rooms have obstacles or traps(green text)
3. Make some rooms monster rooms (red text)
4. Put treasure in (yellow text)
5. Put in environmental objects that can be perceived multiple rooms over like rivers, fires, etc (blue text)

### Color coding text
- Black(#000000): self-contained set dressing/theme for room
- Blue(#1e35c9): Environmental features that can be detected from other rooms
- Red(#a30000): Monsters
- Green(#00a32c): Traps and obstacles
- Yellow(#fff700): Treasure or loot

### Color coding regions

- green: Obstacle
- red: monster den
- yellow: loot hoard

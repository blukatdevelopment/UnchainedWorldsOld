Slime(Any) + Hell Hounds + Spindle Man

## Blue Slime

These little slimes would be harmless, if it weren't for their insatiable appetite for metal objects.

-Immunities: Piercing damage
- Diffuse: Slime melts into a puddle that can rapidly travel over grassy areas. The slime's speed becomes 40 and ranged attacks have disadvantage on it, since it travels beneath the top most layer of grass. It may not attack in this state.

- Cammoflauge: The gray slime looks just like wet rocks when still.

## Yellow Slime

`Yellow Slime, XP: 50, size: Large, HP: 25 (3d12+4), AC: 8, [16, 10, 14, 10, 10, 10], Smother +4 1d6+2 acid damage.`

`Pink Slime, XP: 25, Size: Tiny, HP: 3(1d4), AC: 8, Speed: 5ft, spider climb 5ft, [4, 12, 12, 16, 12, 3]`
- Mind Couple: Over the course of one minute, the pink slime enters in through the ears, nostrils, or mouth of a creature and begins to take telepathic control of them. The target must be unconscious for this to work. Once under control, the slime has access to all their memories and mental faculties. Any psychic damage that the host creature takes is translated to the pink slime directly.

### Hell Hound
Hell Hounds are a rare creature imbued with the ability to open portals to the Material Plane, and are often taken into service in order to retrieve mortals. They do not serve devils, but rather the contracts that devils sign, acting as impartial enforcers of Infernal law. Hell Hounds stand ten feet tall and wield a set of sharp claws. They are wolf-like, with glowing red eyes and mouths.

`Hell Hound, HP: 60(5d12), Size: Large, AC: 14, [17, 14, 16, 12, 16, 6], Claws +5 2d6+3`
- Immune to fire and poison, resistant to non-magical physical damage, weak to radiant

## Spindle Man
A strange creature of legend. This creature stands ten feet tall, but has limbs only an inch thick and a bulbous head that looks like it should be too heavy for the slender frame. It has no hands or feet, with it's limbs terminating in nubs, and it's limbs seem to be prehensile and lack bones.

`Spindle Man, Size: large, HP: 33(3d10+3), AC: 10, Speed: 30ft [16,8,12,12,7,15], Choke DC 13 STR save or 2d6 necrotic damage`

- Teleport: When not actively viewed by another creature, Spindle Man may teleport to any space it sees within 500ft.

# Traps
0: Foot Spike - breakaway floor panel, space with upward pointing spikes + barbed spike
1: Dazzling crossbows and ooze-covered crushing walls triggered by an onyx demonic skull.
2:  Weapon Thrower - Upon triggering the trap it shoots or throws (arrows, blades, bladed disk, darts, harpoon, javelin, needles, shuriken, spears, or spikes) at the target area. For additional fun, the weapons may be barbed, poisoned, or rusty.
3: Panic-inducing bolas and electrical skulls triggered by alternating floor tiles.
4:  Collapsing Structure - The trap destroys critical support beams causing the structure to collapse. The cave-in may be limited to a single (room / passage way / door way) or it might start a chain reaction that starts to collapse the entire dungeon.
5: Gravity reversing beams and electrical skulls triggered by a sacrificial bowl and dagger.
6: Reflecting trap
7: Sinkers and Floaters - A pool with alligators (or whatever aquatic death creatures you desire) in it blocks the path to the other side. There are a series of stones across it, some of the stones are sturdy and real, some of them are actually made of light driftwood painted to look like the other rocks. They are also roped to the bottom of the pool so they look like sturdy rocks. If a PC steps on one of the fake rocks, it will sink quickly under their feet. If a PC is being too slow crossing the pool, the creatures will attack the PC while they are on the rocks.
8:  A pool of filthy water that is infected with a disease.
9: Radiant barbed nets and moldy animated statues triggered by a weapon on an altar.

Flesh Eaters + Abyssal Giant


### Abyssal Giant
The blood steel helmet and cuirass hide the true horror of this monster, which is a hulking heap of rotten corpses joined by a possessing spirit. It has no eyes nor mouth on its head, but perceives spirits to a limited range. The Hell Knight is loyal to it's creator, and will go on a rampage if it's creator dies.

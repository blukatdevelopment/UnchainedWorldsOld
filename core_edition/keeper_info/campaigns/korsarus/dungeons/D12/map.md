Flesh Eaters + Mind Leech

## Stat blocks

### Flesh Eaters
Once humanoids, but corrupted into monsters. Their minds are warped to feel no remorse, and to crave uncorrupted humanoid flesh. If one consumes the flesh of a flesh eater, they become corrupted and themself become a flesh eater. Flesh eaters seek safety in numbers, expanding their populations by force-feeding captured humanoids pieces of themselves. Their regenerative powers grow back flesh and limbs missing from them, but without skin. Instead of blood, flesh eaters ooze a black fluid.

- Rapid regeneration[Recharge 5-6]: Action, Flesh eater regains 2d12 HP, regrowing any missing limbs.

### Swordhands
Sometimes flesh eaters will alter one another, particularly when the mental corruption damages the target's mind. The swordhands is created by when a flesh eater's hands are severed and forced to regrow over swords. Additionally, a thin layer of flesh is sliced off their back and shoulders, and chainmail is draped over so that it meshes with the freshly healed flesh.

## Mind Leech
This telepathic worm is not terribly threatening from a physical standpoint. It instead incapacitates it's targets with telepathically-induced fear before feeding on it. Mind leeches will not kill their targets, and will stop at 1HP when feeding, but they will lay eggs inside the brains of their still-conscious targets that hatch after 3d8 hours if not removed.

`Mind Leech, Size: small, HP: 1, AC: 8, Speed: 10ft [6,6,6,16,12,3], Feed +1 1 piercing damage`
- Psychic Terror: DC 11 WIS save to halve 3d6 psychic damage. If target falls below 1HP, they are instead paralyzed for one hour and stuck at 1HP.

## Stat blocks

### Giant Fly

Wild magic replaced the heads of these humanoids with those of giant leeches. They drink the blood of their victims.

`Leech Man, Size: medium, HP: 5(1d4+1), AC: 11, Speed: 30ft [12,12,12,12,7,15], club +3 1d4+1`
- Feed: DC 13 STR save or take 1d6+1 necrotic damage, which the Leech man gains as HP. Any excess is gained as temporary hit points.

### Chameleoid
Appearing vaguely humanoid, this creature is far more monstrous than any beast folk, having a mind that is nearly feral. Their bulging eyes can turn in independent directions, and their three-fingered hands are capable of grasping objects. Their most distinguishing feature is the ability to blend into their surroundings.

`Chameleoid, Size: large, HP: 28(2d12+4), AC: 14, Speed: 30ft [16,11,15,5,10,3], Spear +5 1d8+3 piercing`
- Multi-attack: May make two slam attacks
- Cammoflage: The Chameleoid's skin changes color to match it's surroundings. A creature must succeed a DC 17 perception to spot a cammoflaged Chameleoid in waiting.

### Trial deets
"Explore these halls. You may touch an item and keep it, but never bare the mark of selflessness after doing so. Observe and refuse three items." (They get teleported out with item, marked with greed tatoo on wrist, cuff, or ankle)
"You refused an item. Give up one prized possession, and it will be transferred to someone in dire need of it."
"I give a copper coin." -> Teleported out.
"I have nothing to give." -> "This is not true. Do you not prize your limbs, ears, eyes, or nose?"
"I still have nothing to give." -> Telported out.

After three possessions are given up -> "One final trial. You may leave here with all your possessions returned to you from people who direly needed them, or you may free the mark of selflessness, which will go to someone in the world who truly needs it. If you free the mark, you may never bare it."

# Tunnels
Delving this incomprehensible maze of tunnels has ended with the death of many souls.

## Delving
Pick one of each roles:
1. Caller: Decides direction party takes
2. Navigator: Remembers way back
3. Scout: Locates threats
4. Prospector: Locates discoveries
Delving or withdrawing both take 1 hour.

### Delve deeper
Roll 1d6. 1 is monster, 6 Discovery.

### Withdrawing
Navigator makes DC 2d10+2 INT check.
Success = depth reduces by one
Failure = go in circles
Failure(5 or more) = depth increases by 1

### Following a trail
Prospector makes DC 2d10+2 INT check

## Monsters
Ask for Wisdom check from the scout. The DC is 2d10+2. Apply any additional bonuses. Succeeding has range of 100ft, undetected by monster. Failure is 30ft, detected by monster. Failure by 5 or more is stumbling into ambush.

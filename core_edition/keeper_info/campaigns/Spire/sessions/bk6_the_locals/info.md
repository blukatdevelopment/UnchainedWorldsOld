## Alice
1. What's one embarassing thing that no one could have ever seen?
2. What's your greatest personal demon?
3. What do you hope for most?
4. What do you fear most?
1. One time while living alone and building a revolver and loading it there was a slight spark that caused a small explosion which singed off all of the hair on her head
2. Would you mind defining personal demon?
3. A lavish life of abundance and emotional fulfillment
4.  The thing she fears most is not having a way out or a lifeboat, abandonment in a social sense, impending doom in a literal sense

## Hyacinth

2. What's your greatest personal demon?
3. What do you hope for most?
4. What do you fear most?
1. Hyacinth cried in her room after her first encounter with Wrath 
2. The fact that she never went back for her brother after her parents abandoned her for being mute 
3. She hopes for most that they learn to see past their narrow view of the world 
4. Her biggest fear is having to open herself up emotionally to someone fully in a non physically romantic way (Like sharing feelings)

## Keal

## Bellatrix

2. What's your greatest personal demon?
3. What do you hope for most?
4. What do you fear most?
1. While in my lab, I got my chemical amounts wrong and the vapors turned my face blue. I had to scrub for hours before I could go out in public. 
2. The need to be the best at everything I come across; I’m not worth anything if I can’t be the best.
3. To help people with my science
4. Never being able to connect with anyone
Is that enough to work with?

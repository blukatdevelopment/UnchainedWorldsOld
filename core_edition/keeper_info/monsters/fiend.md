## Demons
Demons are chaotic evil entities, often former mortals whose souls entered the abyss upon dying. Even the more intelligent demons tend to act rashly, or else by a might-makes-right mentality wherein the strong are in charge, but can be replaced by stronger at any time.

### Soul flame
A soul whose last act is self-destruction in order to inflict harm upon others.

`Soul Flame, XP:0, HP: 1, AC: 8, Speed: 15ft, [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`
- Burn out: The soul flame leaps onto a target and erupts, dealing 1d8 necrotic damage

### Soul sucker
A fleshy snake with a humanoid torso and a mouth like a lamprey. It feasts on the souls of the weak and weary. Soul suckers will run away from light sources and are attracted to the souls of the weak.

`Soul Sucker, XP: 10, Size: Small, HP: 8(2d6), AC: 8, Speed: 40ft, climb 40ft, [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10], Suck: +1 1d4 necrotic`
- Spray Venom: One creature within 10 feet must make a DC8 CON saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute.

### Leech crawlers

`Leech crawler zombie, XP: 25 HP: 13(3d4+4), AC: 10, [14, 10, 18, 10, 8, 10], Unarmed: +3 3 bludgeoning, Pitchfork: +3 1d6 piercing`
- Swarm: Upon death, a swarm of leech crawlers burst from the zombie's body, ready to exact revenge.

`Swarm of Leech Crawlers, XP: 50, HP: 36(3d12), AC: 8, [10, 12, 12, 10, 10, 10], Resistance: physical damage`
- Burrow: Swarm may use action to enter an unconscious creature's nose, ears, and mouth. The creature rises up with 1 hit point, under leech control, and the swarm loses 1 hit point.

### Snork
A four foot featherless bird with a fleshy toothed funnel instead of a beak. They feed on the brains of wounded creatures and are attracted by the sounds of agony. Snorks have a simbiotic relationship with soul suckers and will hunt together. Snorks will run away from light sources.

`Snork, XP: 100, HP: 42(6d6+6), AC: 13, [16, 12, 12, 10, 10, 10]`
- Couple: Target must succeed a DC 12 STR save or else become grappled as the snork attaches to their head and begins searching for a weak in the skull with their internal beak.
- Tap: If coupled, target must make a DC 12 CON save to halve 2d6 piercing damage. If this attack brings a creature to 0 hit points, the snork cracks into the skull and eats their brain.

### Faceless Mistwalker
A small, shriveled humanoid creature. While it isn't physically imposing, it's abilities render it a danger to skilled adventurers and even small armies. It features a bulbous head on a stickly body, two enormous glassy black eyes bulging from it's head. It's nose consists of two slits, and it has a lipless, tongueless, toothless mouth. It's skin ranges from light grey and smoothe when well-fed to wrinkly and dark grey when hungry. After hunting it's prey, it unhinges it's jaw and consumes them whole, it's form stretching to accomodate them. Though it can digest meat, it feeds almost entirely on fear. While alive, it's face cannot be perceived by the direct eye-contact.

`Faceless Mistwalker, HP: 3(1d4-1), AC: 8, [7, 7, 8, 16, 20, 16]`
- Faceless: those that look directly at the mistwalker see a blurred distortion where it's face should be, and must succeed a DC 15 WIS save to halve 3d6 non-lethal psychic damage. If this damage brings the creature below 1HP, they remain conscious, stable, and totally palaryzed.
- Aura of blue flame: All flames within 500ft burn blue. The mistwalker can detect the position and size of these flames.
- Aura of Mist: Within 100ft radius, a thick magical miasma forms, heavily obscuring sight. The creature can lift this mist partially or entirely at will.
- Nightmare: One paralyzed target hallucinates, their mind returning to a traumatic memory. The mistwalker can control entities in this nightmare. If the creature dies in their nightmare, their body also dies.
- Possession: A creature once paralyzed by the mistwalker becomes a conduit for it. Within the aura of blue flame, the mistwalker can possess this creature to access it's thoughts, sensory information, and assert control over it's body. A single action can be resisted by a DC 16 WIS save, and total control with a DC 11 WIS save.

### Grinder
This spherical demon opens into two hemispheres joined by a central stalk. Teeth brim at the edges where these pieces meet, forming a 360 degree mouth. Grinders gnash their teeth constantly, compelled to chew through stone despite the pain it causes them. They have eyes on all sides, and three legs.

`Grinder, XP: 100, HP: 38(4d8+6), AC: 14, [16, 10, 14, 10, 10, 10], Slam +4 1d6+3 bludgeoning, Bite +4 1d8+3 piercing`
- Curl: The grinder can use its bonus action to enter or exit its curled form. When curled, the grinder can move up to 60 feet in a straight line and make a slam attack using its action. While rolled, AC increases by +3.

### Abyssal Giant
The blood steel helmet and cuirass hide the true horror of this monster, which is a hulking heap of rotten corpses joined by a possessing spirit. It has no eyes nor mouth on its head, but perceives spirits to a limited range. The Hell Knight is loyal to it's creator, and will go on a rampage if it's creator dies.

`Abyssal Giant, XP: 450, HP: 63 (5d12+3), AC: 16(Half Plate), [20, 12, 12, 4, 4, 4]. Blood Sword +6 2d8+5 slashing damage`
- Blindsight 30ft, Resistance: Fire
- Destruct: When the Hell Knight is killed, it's blood steel equipment explodes into flame. All creatures within 10ft must succeed a DC 12 dexterity saving throw to halve 1d6 fire damage.
- Engulf: Arms reach out and drag a grappled creature into the Hell Knight's torso. This turn, and at the start of any following, the grappled creature takes 1d4 piercing damage as mouths begin biting and gnawing on them.

### Bone thresher
This orange-fleshed creature has the bones of it's enemies sewed to it's hide as armor. It carries a large bone spear and has a cat of nine tails made with sharpened bone fragments. It wears a necklace of skulls. Surrounding the bone thresher is a roughly 100ft radius cold front.

`Bone Thresher, XP:450, Size: Large, HP: 52(4d12+4), AC: 14(bone armor), [16, 12, 12, 10, 10, 10], Bone Whip(15ft) +5 2d4+3, Bone Spear +5 2d8+3`

### Gattogat
A three-foot tall cat that can stand upright. It's whiskers are bent and it's coat is a bit frazzled and unkempt. It can pretend to be a large housecat, and can also reveal it's true form. It's eyes are bright blue unless it's using it's powers, at which point they turn green.

`Gattogat, XP: 450, size:small, HP: 24(4d4+8), AC 16 (natural armor), [12, 16, 12, 16, 11, 16]`
- Resists: Non-magical physical, psychic
- Charm(1/day): Gatto produces a telepathic illusion from it's eyes. All creatures that can see it must succeed a DC 16 WIS save or they find this very cute and the Gatto has advantage on charisma checks against them.
- Malevolent Guidance: Gatto names a malevolent deed such as stabbing a friend, drinking a poison, or attacking a guard. The target must succeed a DC 16 WIS save or perform the act. If charmed, the target makes the save with disadvantage.
- Gatto Field: While Gatto is conscious and it's eyes are green, it produces a field of distorted psychic energy. Attacks against are made with disadvantage.

## Roth'tanag
This hulking figure is covered in blunt horns made from stone. The creature has a forked tongue and powerful limbs.

`Roth'tanag, HP: 86(10d8+6), AC: 13(Natural Armor), [18, 8, 14, 10, 8, 14]`
- Resists: Non-magical physical damage
- Stone breath[Recharge 5-6]: Creatures within a 15 foot radius must succeed a DC 15 constitution save to halve 2d6 necrotic damage. If a creature fails by 5 or more or is killed by this attack, they are petrified.
- Horn blast: Creature must succeed DC 13 dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 piercing damage.
- Summon Soul flames[Recharge 5-6]: The Roth'tanag summons six soul flames within 30 feet.

## Devils
Devils are a lawful evil fiend drawn to the infernal planes by contract. The infernal sections of the 9 Hells are very orderly, albeit with a constant war waged between devils and demons. Devil law is contractual, and self-enforcing via magic, so devils are perfectfully lawful in that regard.

### Prattler
A soul caught by an infernal "prattle clause" in a devil's contract. Though they need neither sleep, drink, nor food, the second they stop talking for 6 seconds, their soul will be consumed. A common part of the "prattcle clause" allows a prattler to swap places with the soul of another creature it kills.

`Prattler, XP: 50, HP: 15(3d12), AC: 12, [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10], Life Drain: +4 1d6+2 necrotic`
- Vulnerabilities: radiant, Immunities: non-magical physical damage, necrotic

### Vice
This soul rests on the razor's edge between the abyssal and infernal planes, but ultimately is created as a devil by accepting an infernal pact. A vice is the lawful embodiment of a particular deadly sin, and embraces that sin in an intentional fashion.
`Vice, XP: 25, Size: medium, HP: 18(3d6), AC: 11, [11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11], Bite +1 1d4 piercing`
- Sin: Roll for a deadly sin and it's effects.

2. Gluttony: +5 CON, Stomach of holding: The creature's throat leads to a pocket dimension with 100 cubic feet that can hold 500lbs.
3. Greed: +3 INT, +3 CHA, 
4. Sloth: +5 CON, Rest: May cast 1st level sleep spell at will, losing 1d4 HP with each cast.

6. Envy: +3 WIS, +3 DEX, Chatty: May cast Consort With Devils at will.
7. Pride: +5 CHA, Belittle: Knows the Chastize cantrip, gains all damage dealt from casting that spell as temporary HP.
8. Acedia: +5 CON, Resistance: immune to non-magical physical damage and psychic damage.

### Imp
An imp is one of the most common forms of undead, as it's a common first form devils take when they are created from souls in Hell.
`Imp, XP: 25, Size: tiny, HP: 12(2d6), AC: 11, [11, 12, 13, 8, 12, 14], Claws +1 1d4 slashing`
- Devilish trait: When creating an imp, randomly select one impish trait.
1. Infernal lungs: May cast 1st level burning hands spell from it's mouth once per day. 
2. Forked tongue: May cast 1st level Charm Person spell from it's tongue once per day. 
3. Invisible heart: May cast 1st level Invisibility spell on itself from it's heart at will.
4. Adaptive appearance: May cast 1st level Disguise Self spell at will.
5. Winged: Gain a flying speed of 30ft.
6. Scorpion tail: Gain attack, Tail +2 1d4 piercing, DC 14 CON save or 2d6 poison damage.

### Regret
This soul was victim to a deadly sin before it's death, and as a result, it seeks to punish every instance of the sin it can find, which it does through hexes.

`Regret, XP: 50, HP: 16(2d8), speed: 20 fly, [8, 8, 11, 15, 13, 16]`
Regretful hex: One creature the regret can see must succeed a WIS save or else become hexxed. They may repeat this save at the end of each of their turns to end the condition. This ability requires concentration.
1. Lust: Distraction: Target has disadvantage on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws.
2. Gluttony: Hunger: Target must use it's action to eat 2lb of food, or else take 1d12 necrotic damage and lose a stamina die.
3. Greed: Creature must use it's action to attempt to steal an item from a random creature closest to it.
4. Sloth: Slow: Target's movement is halved, it cannot attack multiple times in one turn, and cannot use bonus actions.
5. Wrath: The target's attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage. For every point of extra damage dealt, the target takes 2 points of psychic damage.
6. Envy: Every successful attack made by a creature the target can see provides a -2 penalty for attacks made this turn.
7. Pride: The target's HP is reduced to 1, and it gains temporary HP equal to the HP lost by this reduction. The temp HP drops after 1 minute, or if the regret is killed.
8. Acedia: Unless the target has been attacked or targeted by a hostile spell since it's last turn, it must skip it's turn and immediately use it's reaction to fall prone.

### Devil Scribe
Standing about five feet tall with leathery red skin and black hair, a devil scribe often wears a suit and carries a book of dark magic that it uses to create fiendish contracts. Scribes store their spells in a book.

`Devil Scribe, XP: 300, HP: 36(6d6), AC: 14(natural), [10, 10, 10, 16, 16, 18], Fire Ray +5 2d10 fire, Trident +3 1d6 slashing`

### Hell Knight
Devils who fight long enough under the kingdom of Hell are knighted, and those who are knighted are replaced when they fail to fight with the utmost loyalty and ferocity. There are only ever six Hell knights serving each infernal monarch. Each is adorned in hellknight armor, and given a greatsword. When killed, the entire Hellknight disintegrates and reappears knealing before their Monarch, at their mercy.

`Hell Knight, XP: 2000, HP: 42(3d10+12), AC: 18(plate), [18, 18, 18, 11, 16, 11], Greatsword +7 2d6 slashing 2d6 fire`

### Hell Hound
Hell Hounds are a rare creature imbued with the ability to open portals to the Material Plane, and are often taken into service in order to retrieve mortals. They do not serve devils, but rather the contracts that devils sign, acting as impartial enforcers of Infernal law. Hell Hounds stand ten feet tall and wield a set of sharp claws. They are wolf-like, with glowing red eyes and mouths.

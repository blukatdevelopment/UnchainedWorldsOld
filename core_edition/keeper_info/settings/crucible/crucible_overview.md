## Timeline
The **divines** created the world, then receded into Celestia and the Hells after a bloody civil war. Many creatures emerged after eating the bones of the fallen gods, and for an age **dragons** ruled the world. Magically and technologically augmented warriors known as **titans** dethroned the dragons and took their place, connecting every corner of the world with portals. The titan empire fell into civil war and collapsed, destroying much of their accumulated knowledge in the process. In the aftermath of this ruin, the **empire of man** emerged to unite the world under one banner. A hundred years into the age of man, rebels staged the simultaneous destruction of the empire's portals, fragmenting the world back into insular regions more manageable for rebels and upstart power brokers to seize.

## Magic
**Arcane** magic uses a complex system of runes or other similar focuses to manipulate reality. **Divine** magic, however, is channeled from deities from Celestia. **Wild** magic is innate or harnessed by commanding naturally occurring sources of magic. **Abyssal**, and **Infernal** are like divine magic, but inherently evil and summoned from demons and devils in Hell. Undeath animates the dead. Strong sources of magic may cause corruption.

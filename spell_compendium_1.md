## Cantrips

```
Thornwhip (Cantrip)
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 15 feet

Duration: Instantaneous
Make a melee spell attack against one creature. On a hit, you deal 1d6 slashing
damage and may pull the creature ten feet in your direction, provided it is large
or smaller.
```

## 4th level spells

```
Mind Probe (4th level)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You target one creature who makes a wisdom saving throw. On a success, they receive 1d4 psychic damage.
On a failure, you enter their mind and they fall into a deep trance. While you are in their mind, you may
request information about an event or thought that has occurred in the last hour. The thought could be
internal dialogue, or could be a memory. If you say something to invoke a memory, they must succeed a
wisdom saving throw to avoid thinking of that memory and making it apparent to you. Each round, the
creature can make a wisdom saving throw in order to break the trance.

### Buying starting attributes
When making a character, the cost of a given score is indicated below. Choosing a score with a negative cost will actually award you that many character points.
```
|Score|Cost |
|:----|:----|
|   3 | -10 |
|   4 |  -8 |
|   5 |  -6 |
|   6 |  -4 |
|   7 |  -2 |
|   8 |   0 |
|   9 |   2 |
|  10 |   4 |
|  11 |   8 |
|  12 |  12 |
|  13 |  18 |
|  14 |  24 |
|  15 |  32 |
|  16 |  40 |
```

### Upgrading attributes
Increasing an attribute by 1 costs 10 CHP.

## Attacks
When PCs are attacked, they roll under a relevant attribute or skill to avoid the attack. Generally, body score avoids physical attacks. When a PC makes an attack, they roll under their relevant attribute or skill to land a hit.

### Damage
Melee deals damage equal to the body score divided by 6, while other types of attacks typically damage in multiples of 1d6.

## Skills
A skill can be applied to a check it's relevant to. For instance, if you have archery as a skill, you could apply it's bonus to your body score when shooting bows, or your mind score when recalling information about bows.  It costs 5 character points to gain a level in a skill, which increases the bonus the skill gives by +1. A couple skills are given below, but talk with your keeper in order to create more as needed.
- Intimidation
- Archery
- Driving
- Hacking
- Swordfighting
- Acrobatics

## Modifiers
In addition to attributes and skills, character points can be spent on modifiers, which describe some unique trait about your character.

### Perks
A perk offers a clear advantage to the character, and thus costs character points. Some exmaples below, but work with your keeper to create your own!
- Keen nose(1CHP): You can detect even faint scents and discern their nature.
- Claws(5CHP): your melee attacks with your claws deal +2 more damage 
- Winged flight(10CHP): you can fly on wings.

### Flaws
Adding a flaw to your character awards character points.
- Short-sighted(+1CHP): Without glasses or contacts, you have a hard time seeing at a distance, and suffer a -2 penalty to related checks.
- Delicate hands(+5CHP): Your melee attack damage has a -2 penalty. 
- Non-verbal(+10CHP): You are not capable of speaking verbally.

## Supplement packs
A keeper may wish to offer players with specific options for skills, perks, and flaws to match the setting their game will take place in.

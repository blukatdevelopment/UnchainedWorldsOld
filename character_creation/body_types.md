# 3d4 body types
Your body determines the mechanical differences of a creature.
Roll 3d4 and see the outcome listed in the table below. If you would prefer a
specific body type, work with your GM to find options that work at your table.
These options are intentionally unbalanced. If you use this unbalance in a way
that adversely effects the fun of the rest of the table, your table may
rightfully give you a wedgie.

```
+------+-----------+

+------+-----------+
```

for dexterity.

```

```

made for large creatures deal double the number of dice in damage when wielded
by you.

## Fierce
Whether you're human, beast folk, or some other sort of creature, you are quite
physically impressive. Your mental accuity seems to suffer from this, however.

| 8    | Corrupted    |
+------+--------------+
```

## Wise Beast
Whether you are a domesticated or wild species, common or exotic, you are more
than a mere beast. Inside your head is a brain as sophisticated as a humanoid's.
You may clumsily manipulate objects or carry them in your mouth, but wielding
weapons is out of the question. Most will confuse you for a normal beast.

Size: Medium
Speed: 30ft

```

### Shapeshift
You may change your physical form to match that of a creature with a common body
type, provided you have seen that creature before. This change lasts until you
are reduced to 0 hit points. Shapeshifting using an action takes roughly six
seconds to complete. Shapeshifting via free object interaction or reaction
consumes one stamina die and is nearly-instantaneous.

material plane as a spirit. If cut, you bleed ectoplasm instead of blood. You
have resistance against non-magical physical damage and necrotic damage. You
are vulnerable to radiant damage, and have disadvantage on saving throws to
resist divine magical effects.

```

corporeal and incorporeal forms. When incorporeal, you enter the ethereal plane
and can view, but not interact with the happenings of the material plane.

### Invisibility
You may use your action to consume two stamina dice and turn invisible for one
minute.


### Shift
Your true form has bright blue skin and no hair. You may use an action to mold
your appearance to either match that of someone you have seen, or to return to
your true form. You may only mimmick a creature with a common body type.

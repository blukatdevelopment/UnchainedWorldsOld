```

### Infuser
You learn to channel energy from the weave into stones of precious nature, and
store that latent energy. The stones may be rubies, emeralds, or other gems
worth at least 5GP each. These are known as soul stones, and you start with one.
When you spend an hour resting, you may refill a single soul stone with energy.
You may fill up to 8 soul stones during a rest. A soul stone may be exhausted by
certain abilities, while other abilities may occupy soul stones, preventing you
from charging and expending so long as they are occupied. You additionally have
an infuser, a device that is capable of applying the magical energy in a number
of ways. You may make any one-handed melee weapon into an infuser, but you may
only have one at a time.

#### Soul blade
You expend a soul stone and a brightly colored energy blade extends from the end
of the infuser. You are proficient with this one-handed blade, and it deals 1d12
radiant damage on a hit. The blade puts out bright light for 20ft, and dim light
for 20ft past that. The blade dissipates after one minute.

#### Soul Protection
You expend a soul stone and infuse one creature with a protective aura. The
creature gains 1d12 temporary hit points and has advantage on wisdom saving
throws so long as they have temporary hit points left.

#### Soul healing
You expend a soul stone and infuse one creature with healing magic. If the
creature's soul was created by you, they gain 3d4 hit points. Otherwise, they
gain 1d8 hit points.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d6+CON.

### Enhanced Infuser
You learn to create a more advanced infuser. Pick one of the following upgrades:

#### Healing cloud
Soul healing now effects all creatures of your choice within 5ft of you.

#### Soul Jet
You aim your infuser in a direction and expend a soul stone. A jet of soul mist
fires from it, propelling you up to 60 feet in that direction. This movement
does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If you land within 5ft of a creature,
you may make an attack as part of this ability.

#### Soul burst
You stab or slam your infuser into the ground and a sphere of smoke appears
above your head, bursting into a shockwave that pushes all creatures within
5ft of you. Each creature takes 1d6 thunder damage and must succeed a strength
save (DC = 8 + WIS modifier + proficiency bonus) to avoid being pushed away from
you by 10ft.

#### Great soul blade
When you use the soul blade ability, it is now a two-handed blade with a 10ft
reach that deals 3d6 radiant damage on a hit.

#### Dual soul blade
When you use the soul blade ability, your infuser breaks into two pieces,
creating a soul blade in each hand. Each blade has the Light property.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d6+CON.

### Hit point re-roll
Now, and again each time you gain a level from now on, you recalculate your hit
points. Roll 3d6 and add your CON modifier three times. If the value rolled is
higher than your current max hit points, you may keep it.

### Discipline
Choose one of the following disciplines: Demon Forger, Technomancer, or pocket
trainer. You gain a feat in this discipline now, as well as at levels 5, 7, and
9. See the disciplines section for more details.


## Disciplines

### Demon Forger

### Technomancer

### Pocket trainer
At level 3, you become a trainer of monsters that live in bespoke pocket
dimensions. You gain one pocket ball, a latched metal ball that contains a soul
gem that is occupied by this ball. You may use your action to open the pocket
ball and point to an empty space, causing the monster in the pocket ball to
appear there. Likewise, you may use your action to open an empty pocket ball and
point to one of your monsters, withdrawing them to the pocket ball's dimension.
You may have one monster out of it's ball at once. If your monster casts a
spell level 1 or higher, it uses either it's wisdom or charisma score, your
choice.

#### Creating monsters
Using your infuser, you weave the essence of your monster according to your

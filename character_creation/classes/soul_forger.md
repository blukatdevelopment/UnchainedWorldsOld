## Features

### Scrap
One unit of scrap consists of 10lb of iron or other metal. It can be purchased
from most shops for 1GP. During a partial or full rest, you may break down
metal items into scrap. When you break down a batch of metal items, divide the
total weight by 10 to find the number scrap units you get. The remainder is
wasted.

### Forge
During a partial or full rest, you may build chassis, components, or soul
stones. A soul stone requires 15 units of scrap. Each chassis and component
has it's scrap cost listed in it's respective section. Part of forging
involves removing impurities and extracting trace alchemical ingredients.
You may have a number of souls stones equal to your proficiency bonus + your
intelligence modifier active at any one time. Your constructs each have their
own turn in initiative, unless you are piloting or carrying them.

### Repair
During a short rest, you may repair one construct. To do so, make an
intelligence check and add your proficiency bonus. This is the amount of hit
points you restore for the targeted construct. Your constructs may discharge
their soul stones. If this happens, you may expend one of your hit dice to
recharge the soul stone.

### Command
On your turn, you may consume a hit die to use your bonus action and issue one
of the following commands to your constructs:
- Retreat: Your constructs move their full movement away from the combat.
- Advance: Your constructs move their full movement toward enemies.
- Focus fire: Each construct may make a ranged attack against the designated target.
- Regroup: Your constructs move their full movement towards you.

### Field Repair
You may expend a hit die and an action to use tinker's tools or a heavy wrench
to get an unconscious construct running again.

### Miniaturization
You have learned to fit more mechanisms in less space. Pick a component that
requires two or more slots. It now requires half as many slots to install,
rounded up.

## Designing a Construct

### Chassis
Choose the body of your construct. Each requires a certain number of
intact soul stones to operate. Having less than that causes the construct to
fall unconscious. When using a special ability, roll the chassis's discharge
dice. If any of the dice roll a 1, a soul stone is discharged from the
construct. Note: your constructs share your proficiency bonus.

#### Tiny Chassis
Tiny constructs can be carried in an adventurer's pocket or on their shoulder.
An adventurer can wield a tiny construct as if it were a light crossbow,
and substitutes construct's dexterity for their own when making ranged attacks
in this way. A tiny chassis requires 1 soul stone and 1 scrap to construct.

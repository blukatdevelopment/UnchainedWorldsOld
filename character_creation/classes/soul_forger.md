### Infuser
You learn to channel energy from the weave into stones of precious nature, and store that latent energy. The stones may be rubies, emeralds, or other gems worth at least 5GP each. These are known as soul stones, and you start with one. When you spend an hour resting, you may refill a single soul stone with energy. You may fill up to 8 soul stones during a rest. A soul stone may be exhausted by certain abilities, while other abilities may occupy soul stones, preventing you from charging and expending so long as they are occupied. You additionally have an infuser, a device that is capable of applying the magical energy in a number of ways. You may make any one-handed melee weapon into an infuser, but you may only have one at a time.

#### Soul blade
You expend a soul stone and a brightly colored energy blade extends from the end of the infuser. You are proficient with this one-handed blade, and it deals 1d12 radiant damage on a hit. The blade puts out bright light for 20ft, and dim light for 20ft past that. The blade dissipates after one minute.

#### Soul Protection
You expend a soul stone and infuse one creature with a protective aura. The creature gains 1d12 temporary hit points and has advantage on wisdom saving throws so long as they have temporary hit points left.

#### Soul healing
You expend a soul stone and infuse one creature with healing magic. If the creature's soul was created by you, they gain 3d4 hit points. Otherwise, they gain 1d8 hit points.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d6+CON.

### Enhanced Infuser
You learn to create a more advanced infuser. Pick one of the following upgrades:

#### Healing cloud
Soul healing now effects all creatures of your choice within 5ft of you.

#### Soul Jet
You aim your infuser in a direction and expend a soul stone. A jet of soul mist fires from it, propelling you up to 60 feet in that direction. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If you land within 5ft of a creature, you may make an attack as part of this ability.

#### Soul burst
You stab or slam your infuser into the ground and a sphere of smoke appears above your head, bursting into a shockwave that pushes all creatures within 5ft of you. Each creature takes 1d6 thunder damage and must succeed a strength save (DC = 8 + WIS modifier + proficiency bonus) to avoid being pushed away from you by 10ft.

#### Great soul blade
When you use the soul blade ability, it is now a two-handed blade with a 10ft reach that deals 3d6 radiant damage on a hit.

#### Dual soul blade
When you use the soul blade ability, your infuser breaks into two pieces, creating a soul blade in each hand. Each blade has the Light property.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d6+CON.

### Hit point re-roll
Now, and again each time you gain a level from now on, you recalculate your hit points. Roll 3d6 and add your CON modifier three times. If the value rolled is higher than your current max hit points, you may keep it.

### Discipline
Choose one of the following disciplines: Devil Forger. You gain a feat in this discipline now, as well as at levels 5, 7, and 9. See the disciplines section for more details.

## Disciplines

### Devil Forger
Devils are born of magical contracts. Whether through a mentoring devil, or by independent discovery, you have learned the art of drafting magically-binding contracts. You know the infernal language. You know the 4th level Summon Devil spell, which you may cast at will to summon devils that have an active pact with you.

#### Pact of Creation
At 3rd level, You may find a venue where at least one humanoid has died, and spend ten minutes reciting the terms of your pact. You describe the body they may inhabit, and that they must swear fealty to you, and the debt they must repay to end that fealty. At this time, you must succeed a charisma(persuasion, deception, or intimidation) check in order to convince the spirits to accept this contact, with the DC set by the keeper. You may choose Vice, Imp, or Regret. The devil's body is formed around one of your soul gems, and preserved by occupying that gem. A devil only occupies soul gems when it's in an active pact with you.

##### Imp
An imp is one of the most common forms of undead, as it's a common first form devils take when they are created from souls in Hell.
```
Imp, XP: 25, Size: tiny, HP: 12(2d6), AC: 11, [11, 12, 13, 8, 12, 14], Claws +1 1d4 slashing`

```

##### Regret
This soul was victim to a deadly sin before it's death, and as a result, it seeks to punish every instance of the sin it can find, which it does through hexes.


```
Regret, XP: 50, HP: 16(2d8), speed: 20 fly, [8, 8, 11, 15, 13, 16]
Regretful hex: One creature the regret can see must succeed a WIS save or else become hexxed. They may repeat this save at the end of each of their turns to end the condition. This ability requires concentration.
1. Lust: Distraction: Target has disadvantage on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws.

3. Greed: Creature must use it's action to attempt to steal an item from a random creature closest to it.
4. Sloth: Slow: Target's movement is halved, it cannot attack multiple times in one turn, and cannot use bonus actions.
5. Wrath: The target's attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage. For every point of extra damage dealt, the target takes 2 points of psychic damage.
6. Envy: Every successful attack made by a creature the target can see provides a -2 penalty for attacks made this turn.
7. Pride: The target's HP is reduced to 1, and it gains temporary HP equal to the HP lost by this reduction. The temp HP drops after 1 minute, or if the regret is killed.
8. Acedia: Unless the target has been attacked or targeted by a hostile spell since it's last turn, it must skip it's turn and immediately use it's reaction to fall prone.
```

##### Vice
This soul rests on the razor's edge between the abyssal and infernal planes, but ultimately is created as a devil by accepting an infernal pact. A vice is the lawful embodiment of a particular deadly sin, and embraces that sin in an intentional fashion.

```
Vice, XP: 25, Size: medium, HP: 18(3d6), AC: 11, [11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11], Bite +1 1d4 piercing

You describe the augmentation you offer, the price of swearing fealty, and the debt they must repay to end that fealty. At this time, you must succeed a charisma(persuasion, deception, or intimidation) check in order to convince the spirits to accept this contact, with the DC set by the keeper. You may select additional augmentations, which will each occupy a soul gem. Choose one or more of the following augmentations:
1. Size: Devil grows 2 sizes larger, they gain a claw attack that deals 3d6+STR slashing damage.
2. Ferocity: Devil may make one additional attack when it takes the attack action.

#### Pact of Dominion
At 7th level, you learn a new pact, which you can offer to any devil that has paid off it's debt of creation to you. You describe an area of a realm which the devil will have dominion over, the price of the devil and all it's underlings swearing fealty to you, and the debt it must repay to end that fealty. The first time you make this pact, a personal dimension with a one square mile section of red stone floating in in a void. Every other time you make this pact, the realm grows by 1 mile. You may use the Summon Devil spell to open a portal to this dimension by speaking it's name, coming and going as you please.

##### Infernal army
Every month, each of the devils under a pact of dominion recruit subordinate devils. Each dominion devil can have a maximum of 4 subordinates, and they recruit up to 1d4 new subordinates per month. When you cast Summon Devil, you may call forth just the subordinates of one of your dominion devils, and they will obey you as if they had a pact with you directly.

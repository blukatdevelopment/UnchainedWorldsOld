undead, capable of raising others as undead soldiers and prolonguing their own
existance beyond any reasonable norm at great cost.

## Starting Hitpoints
You start with 4+CON Hitpoints.

### Phylactery
In order to be a lich you must posess a phylactery. If you take this class from
the start of a campaign one is already in your posession, if you are a commoner 
and wish to become a lich you must create a phylactery. A phylactery is a
magical trinket made of various items of importance to the lich who posesses it
these items are tasked with containing your original soul and any souls you
may obtain. When a creature who has a soul dies within 30 feet of you, you may 
use a reaction to capture their soul and contain it within your phylactery. 
At first level your phylactery is only capable of containing 2 souls, 
excluding your original soul; the Max Souls column shows the maximum number 
of Souls you may have at any given level. Your phylactery has 10Hp, if reduced 
to 0 hitpoints it is destroyed and you die instantly as all the souls 
within are released.

### Lichdom
You have undergone an irreversible magical transformation turning you into a
lich. Your creature type becomes undead and you become immune to necrotic damage
but weak to radiant damage. You no longer require food, drink, or sleep to live,
no longer breath, and have no discernable heartbeat. In order to upkeep your 
undead form you must consume one soul every week, destroying it. If you die and
have at least one soul left in your phylactery you may consume that soul and 
reform from your phylactery over the course of 1d4 hours. If you are ever forced
to consume your own original soul you become a husk and are effectively dead as 
your corpse wanders creation with your mind trapped inside.

### Soulcasting
You gain the ability to cast using the souls that you have contained in your 
phylactery. Constitution is your spellcasting ability. You learn two cantrips 
Your spell DC (difficulty class) is 8 + proficiency bonus + Constitution 
modifier. Your spell attack modifier is proficiency bonus + Constitution 
modifier. You do not require a spellcasting focus to cast as your body is
effectively filling that role.

```
|:------------|:------------|
| Spell Level |  Soul Cost  |
|:------------|:------------|
| Cantrip     |          1  |
| 1           |          2  |
| 2           |          3  |
| 3           |          6  |
| 4           |          8  |
| 5           |         15  |
|:------------|:------------|
```

### Preparing Spells
During a long rest you may commune with you phylactery in order to change the 
spells currently avaliable to you, you do not need to physically come in contact
with your phylactery to commune with it. Communing may look like adding various 
trinkets, flowers, spices, perfumes, or spell components to your phylactery in 
order to appease the souls within, commanding the souls within to bend to your 
will and obey you, or some other thing. No matter how it looks for you,
communing augments a number of spells equal to half your lich level 
(rounded down) plus your Con modifier, minimum of one spell. You may 
select these spells from the lich spell list, and they must be first level or 
higher. You may only cast spells that you have prepared.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d4+CON.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d4+CON.

### Undead Domination
Your flavor of undeath exerts an influence on the minds of lesser undead. When
you encounter an undead creature that does not posess sapience, you may expend a
stamina die as an action on your turn to force them to make a constitution 
saving throw against your spellcasting DC; falling under your control for a 
number of minutes equal to your roll on a failure.

### Hit point re-roll
Now, and again each time you gain a level from now on, you recalculate your hit 
points. Roll 3d4 and add your CON modifier three times. If the value rolled is 
higher than your current max hit points, you may keep it.

### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores 
of your choice by 1. You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

### Ability Score increase

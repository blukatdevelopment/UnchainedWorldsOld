## Features

### Ki
You are capable of ducking, dodging, redirecting, and absorbing many attacks made at you. The energy used to perform this evasion is known as Ki. You may replenish your ki by using your bonus action to expend a stamina die. When you do, roll all your ki dice. You may either take the amount rolled, or instead keep the amount of ki you already have.

Prototypes that aren't fit for mass production and widespread use? Yes, please!
You thrive on purpose-built gadgets and gizmos of varying levels of absurdity.
Only you seem to have the wherewithal to perform the minor tuning of tolerances,
preventative maintenance, and repairs to keep these things barely running.

is visible on one a glass window on the ball's side. You may inscribe a message
on each face. To use the prognosticator, shake it thoroughly while asking a
question, then roll a 1d4 to see the result displayed. The default answers
are displayed in the table below. You may tamper with the prognosticator to
make it more likely to give one answer than the other. When you do, you may
roll 2d4 and choose your preferred outcome.

```
+------+--------------------+
| Roll |       Answer       |
+------+--------------------+
|    1 | It is certain.     |
|    2 | As I see it, yes.  |

allowing the wearer to see behind them. This prevents enemies from sneaking up
behind them. It also allows the wearer to spy on those they have their back to.

### Projector
A 5lb bullseye lamp with a small reel of up to 60 transparent slides. The images
on the slides may be hand-drawn or produced by the soul stealer. You may turn
a small crank or set a clockwork mechanism to advance the slides at your desired
pace. Once the last slide has shown, the first slided is loaded to loop the
presentation. The clockwork's spring lasts for one minute, regardless of the
speed, before it requires additional winding.

it. Once you fix this massive drillbit to the Steam Powered Tool, you may
borrow a medium-sized hole into the ground, gaining a dig speed of 20ft. You
may not dash to dig faster.

### Net cannon
This hand cannon fires a weighted net. It has a range of 15/30 feet. This net gun fires a net that, upon a hit, restrains a large or smaller creature. On each turn, the restrained creature can use their action to succeed a DC 16 strength save to break free from the net. The net has an AC of 10 and 5 hit points, an can be targeted to rip the net open. Requires an action to reload, stocked with one net.

silvered foil. By turning a crank, one may rapidly record these images onto
sections of the silvered foil.

### FSS (Firing Solution System)
Many uses. You can mount a crossbow on this tripod, which contains a series of clockwork logic circuits connected to various sensors. Simply spend one minute following the simple 20-step callibration process, and the firing solution system will automatically adjust the position of the crossbow to match trajectory and windage for the point in your crosshairs. If moved, the FSS will need to be recalibrated. Once calibrated, the weapon connected to the FSS can be used at maximum range without incurring disadvantage, and can be used within normal range with advantage.

### Rocksenbocksen
Many uses. A case containing a few special rocks floating in a heavy fluid. Each has an arrow carved on it. A lodestone is grey and always points north, or towards a nearest deposit of iron.

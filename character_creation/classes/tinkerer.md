Prototypes that aren't fit for mass production and widespread use? Yes, please!
You thrive on purpose-built gadgets and gizmos of varying levels of absurdity.
Only you seem to have the wherewithal to perform the minor tuning of tolerances,
preventative maintenance, and repairs to keep these things barely running.

## Contraptions

### Flame Thrower
1 use. This contraption sprays a fuel-air mixture past an ignition point and creates a 15 foot cone of fire.
All creatures within the cone must make a dex save, receiving 3d6 damage on a save and half as much on a failure.

### Grapple Shot
Many use. This contraption fires a grappling hook up to 600 feet, and has a crank that can reel in a large or smaller creature. If the grapple shot is mounted to a sturdy object, it automatically succeeds in reeling in the target 30 feet per every 6 seconds. Otherwise, the wielder must succeed an opposing athletics check to not have the grapple shot yanked out of their hands.

### Flash card
1 use. This is a card with flash powder glued to it and a short fuse. Once lit, it can be slid into a narrow space such as an open window or under a door. When it goes off, all creatures that can see it must succeed a DC 16 constitution saving throw or be blinded. Each round, the saving throw can be repeated in order to end the blinding effect.

### Poison Puffer
6 uses. This contraption puffs a concentrated burst of poison into the air. The cloud is 10 feet in diameter and lingers in the air for 6 seconds. A creature that starts it's turn in this cloud or enters the cloud must succeed a DC 14 constitution saving throw or become poisioned and receive 1d6 poison damage.

### Mounted Lantern
Many uses. This contraption is a small bullseye lantern that can be mounted to a helmet, crossbow, or other mobile object. If it takes damage, it will explode and cause 1d4 fire damage to whomever is within 5ft of it.

### Glider suit
Many uses. This contraption is an outfit that features either bat-like, feathery wings, or leather wings. When wearing the suit, you can drop slowly, moving 60 feet horizontally for every 10 feet you fall, and do not receive fall damage. If you fall unconscious while gliding, you begin a normal descent.

### Clockwork trigger
Many uses. This contraption triggers another contraption after a timer runs out. It can be set to up to 1 hour. After use, the trigger must be reset.

### Trip wire trigger
Many uses. This contraption is a string that is set between two points, and will trigger a contraption it is attached to when stepped on. After use, the trigger must be reset.

### Sound trigger
Many uses. This contraption triggers a connected contraption in response to a loud sound such as screaming.

### Lightning pack
Many uses. This contraption consists of a backpack with an 10ft antenna connected by wire to an emitter ray gun. During a long rest when there is thunder and lightning, one can charge the lightning pack by exposing it to a lightning strike. Once charged, it has a single shot. A shot from a lightning pack fires a lightning bolt 50 feet in a straight line. All creatures within the bolt's path must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 4d6 lightning damage, and half as much on a success.

### Auto hand crossbow
Many uses. This hand-crossbow has a pneumatic cocking mechanism and an internal magazine which holds 20 crossbow bolts. It loses the ammunition property. After firing the auto hand crossbow with an action, it can be fired a additional time using a bonus action.

### Steam Powered Tool
This backpack steam-powered unit has multiple heads that can be replaced to function as different tools. The tool requires both hands. Once powered up, the tool remains powered for one minute. At the end of the duration, the tool requires one hour of maintenance to power up again.
- Drill: digs a small-sized hole that medium-sized creatures can squeeze through. It grants the user a borrowing speed of 5ft, and can dig through stone.
- Chainsaw: can carve through wood easily. When used as a melee weapon, it deals 1d12 slashing damage.
- Bolt gun: Can drive bolts into wooden surfaces. When used as a weapon, has a range of 15/30ft, deals 1d6 piercing damage.

### Net cannon
This hand cannon fires a weighted net. It has a range of 15/30 feet. This net gun fires a net that, upon a hit, restrains a large or smaller creature. On each turn, the restrained creature can use their action to succeed a DC 16 strength save to break free from the net. The net has an AC of 10 and 5 hit points, an can be targeted to rip the net open.

### Crank Jack
This machine can be wedged in a narrow space and ratcheted to lift objects up to 2 tons, or force doors open.

### Jolt rod
Many uses. This contraption consists of a cell that releases a small amount of lightning into a connected metal melee weapon. When you activate the rod, the next attack you make with it's attached weapon deals an additional 1d12 lightning damage. After discharging a jolt rod, it requires 10 minutes of cranking to recharge.

### Soul Stealer
One use. This box contains a peephole to aim with and a shutter to use the gox. When used in bright light, the picture box captures an image onto a sheet of silvered foil.

### FSS (Firing Solution System)
Many uses. You can mount a crossbow on this tripod, which contains a series of clockwork logic circuits connected to various sensors. Simply spend one minute following the simple 20-step callibration process, and the firing solution system will automatically adjust the position of the crossbow to match trajectory and windage for the point in your crosshairs. If moved, the FSS will need to be recalibrated. Once calibrated, the weapon connected to the FSS can be used at maximum range without incurring disadvantage, and can be used within normal range with advantage.

### Rocksenbocksen
Many uses. A case containing a few special rocks floating in a heavy fluid. Each has an arrow carved on it. A lodestone is grey and always points north, or towards a nearest deposit of iron. The soulstone is black and always points towards South, or to a nearby source of undead energy. The light stone is bright white, turning according to the time of day and is accurate to the hour.

### Hunter's Hands
Many uses. The dominant hand of this pair of gauntlets has a hunter's trap installed on it. When you land an unarmed attack with it, you spring the trap and deal an additional 1d10 piercing damage. It takes one action to re-arm the hunter's hands.

### Martial Countermeasure System
Many uses. This cuirass contains several telescopic spikes deployed by miniature blasting charges. When you are grappled, you may use your reaction to fail the grapple and instead activate the cuirass, causing 2d10 piercing damage to the grappler. You may also trigger the cuirass as part of a successful grapple of your own, dealing 2d10 piercing damage to the grappled. Once activated, it takes 10 minutes to replace the fuses on the cuirass.

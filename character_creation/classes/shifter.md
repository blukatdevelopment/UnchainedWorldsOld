## Features

### Shifter Form
Choose from werewolf, wererat, or werebear, which is the form that you assume each time you shift. While shifting, your body grows and stretches, transforming into a shifter. While in your shifter form, your stamina die's size changes according to your form. The werewolf has a D10, the wererat D8, and the werebear D12. Whether the shift is controlled or not, you may expend one or more stamina dice, rolling them and adding this amount to your current and maximum hit points. When you shift ends and you leave your shifter form, your maximum hit points return to their normal amount and your hit points are reduced to 1.

#### Uncontrolled shifting
There are certain triggers that may cause you to involuntarily enter your shifter form. When you experience one of these triggers, you must make a wisdom save against it's DC(indicated in the Uncontrolled shift triggers table) You may expend a stamina die to remake the throw. If you fail this check, you involuntarily enter your shifter form. During an uncontrolled shift, you may remake the wisdom saving throw once each minute. While uncontrolled, the GM, or someone designated by them takes control of your character, applying logic from the uncontrolled shift behavior flowchart. If you succeed the check, you are immune to being triggered for the next hour.

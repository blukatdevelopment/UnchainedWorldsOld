As an action you may expend a number of your stamina dice and change an amount
of mutations currently affecting your body equal to the amount of stamina dice
you expended. This change takes 10 minutes and during that time you are
incapacitated as your body shifts and grows its new mutations. You may exchange

epic mutation, This exchange consumes 10 stamina dice.

## Colossal Mutations

### Throwing Arms.
Your arms become approximately the length of your legs, allowing you to expend
a stamina die and sling a piece of debris at a target within 120 feet of you.
Make a thrown weapon attack against a target, the target takes 3d8 bludgeoning
damage if your attack hits. Regardless of if the attack hits or not, every
creature within 5 feet of the target, including the target, must succeed a DC 14
Dexterity saving throw or take 3d4 piercing damage as the debris breaks apart
upon impact.

### Thick Hide.
Your skin grows thick and leathery, or hard and scaly proofing you against
attacks. You gain resistance to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing attacks
from non-magical weapons.

### Fire Bladder.
You grow a gland in your throat that holds chemicals which, when combined, can
release blasts of corrosive liquid or roaring flame. As an action you may expend
two stamina dice to expell a 100 foot line or a 30 foot cone of roaring flames
or corrosive acid forcing everyone in the area to make a DC 14 dexterity saving
throw or take 4d8 fire or acid damage, taking half as much on a success.

### Elemental Absorption.
Pick two damage types from acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. You become
resistant to these two damage types.

### Massive Claws.
If you already have claws they grow larger, and if you do not you grow 
massive claws.  Attacking with these claws deals 3d12 slashing damage rather 
than the usual 3d8. You are capable of retracting and extending these claws as a
free action.

### Shrunken Amygdala.
The part of your brain responsible for fear response and reaction to frightening
stimuli shrinks, you become immune to the frightened condition and the charmed
condition.

### Keen Smell.
You gain a forked tongue or a heightened sense of smell from an already existing
orifice. You gain advantage on perception checks based on smell and you are
capable of tracking creatures by smell up to two weeks after they were present
in an area.

### Shield-like Callus.
You grow a flat, hard growth on the forearm attached to your nondominant hand,
this growth gives you a +2 to AC as if it were weilding a shield. You are not 
capable of wielding a shield in your offhand while your form is mutated in this 
way.
 
### Keen Sight.
Your eyes grow large and reflect light in low light conditions. You gain
perception on sight based perception checks and darkvision out to a range of 120
feet, you have disadvantage on perception checks to see things directly in
sunlight.

### Shrunken Prefrontal Cortex.
The risk management centers of your brain shrink. All attacks you make are made
at advantage, but all attacks made against you have advantage aswell

### Secondary Arms.
You grow a pair of secondary arms underneeth your primary ones. Your carrying
and pushing capacity doubles and you are capable of making an unarmed strike as
a bonus action. You require 50 extra pounds of food every day to nourish these
new appendages. 

### Reactive Immunity.
Rather than growing a physiologically obvious mutation your body becomes
prepared to rapidly form a wide array of them. As a reaction to having a status
effect applied to yourself you may expend and roll a stamina die as your body
makes a reactive mutation to negate the status effect. You become immune to the
triggering status effect for a number of hours equal to the roll of your stamina
die, you may not take this reaction again until the full time has elapsed. Some
examples of reactive mutations would be growing extra sets of eyes to negate
blindness, the instant formation of an additional filtration organ in your
circulatory system to negate the poisoned status effect, or a rapid increase of
mass in your legs to negate the prone condition. This reactive mutation may have
unforseen benefits or drawbacks as decided by your keeper.

### Limited Wings. (Level 9 Required)
Wing-like appendages grow from your back, you may expend a stamina die to gain a
flying speed of 60 feet for 6 seconds as you expend a large amount of energy to
lift your body. As a reaction to falling you may use this ability to reduce 
your speed and slow your descent for a safe landing.

### Rampage. (level 9 Required)
The part of your brain responsible for anger expands, heightening your anger
response. As a bonus action, you may expend five stamina dice to enter a 
trance-like rampage state for the next hour. While in this ramage state you gain 
the following benefits and penalties:

- You regain 1d10 hitpoints for every 100 pounds of consumable material you
ingest
- Your mutations require no stamina dice to activate
- You gain advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws
- Your attacks deal highest possible damage regardless of your rolls
- You are unable to concentrate on anything other than destruction, making you
automatically fail saving throws and checks with abilities other than Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution
- You lack all foresight and once you accomplish your original reason for
entering rampage you begin destroying and killing indiscriminately.

If you wish to end your rampage early you may make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw
as a free action, ending your rampage on a success. Once you take this free
action you may not do so again until a minute has passed. If your wisdom
modifier is too low to beat this DC you instead pass on a natural roll of 20.

### Titan's Roar. (Level 9 Required)
Your throat canal forms funnel shaped, allowing you to expel a roar of great 
magnitude as if through a megaphone. As an action you may expend 3 stamina dice 
and roll them. Up to 4 creatures of your choice which can hear the roar gain the
following benefits:

- They gain Temporary hitpoints equal to the amount rolled 
- Their size becomes one size larger than their size at the time of the roar
- They gain advantage on saving throws, ability checks, and attack rolls 

as you call for their DNA to reshape them into a more powerful form. After 1d4 
minutes has elapsed they return to their normal form and lose the temporary 
hitpoints. You may also use this mutation to project your voice up to three 
times the normal distance it would otherwise be able to be heard from.

### Enlarged Brainstem. (Level 9 Required)
Your brainstem enlarges, heightening your reflexes. You are capable of making a 
reaction every turn rather than once between your turns.

### Quickened Immune System. (Level 9 Required)
Your body heat increases significantly as your immune system speeds up and your
body's natural regenerative ability is enhanced. When taking a rest you regain
all your hitpoints without expending any stamina dice, provided you have 
consumed  300 or more pounds of food in the past 12 hours. In battle you may 
expend and  roll a stamina dice to force a quickened regeneration process, 
healing you for 5 plus the ammount rolled. You also become immune to the 
diseased status effect and lose stamina dice to cold at one third the rate.

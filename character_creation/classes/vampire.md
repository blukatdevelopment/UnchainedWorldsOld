## Features

### Vampirism
Due to circumstances that may or may not have been beyond your control you have
been accursed with vampirism. You gain the following benefits and drawbacks.

Benefits:
- You cannot be outright killed unless through one of the specified means.
- When reduced to 0 hitpoints or below you do not have to roll staminda dice to 
avoid death, instead you simply enter an unconcious state where you regain 
hitpoints over the course of 8 hours, awaking with full hitpoints after the time 
has elapsed. this process takes only 5 minutes in moonlight.
- You gain a bite and a claw unarmed attack, the teeth and claws used for these 
attacks are retractable at will. Your claw attack deals 1d6+Dexterity or 
Strength slashing damage, you may make an additonal strike with your claws if
your first attack on your turn hits. Your bite attack deals 1d8+Strength or 
Constitution piercing damage, if you hit with a bite attack you may choose to 
either regain hitpoints equal to half the damage delt (Provided the target is
not a construct) or add half the damage delt to your next attack roll.
- You gain 10 additional feet of walking and climbing speed.
- You do not need to eat, drink, or sleep.
- You are capable of seeing in complete darkness as if bright light for 90 feet,
and dim light past that point. You can see in dim light as if it is bright light.
- You no longer physically age.

Drawbacks:
- You are outright killed if you take damage of the radiant or fire damage type
equal to or greater than 2 times your maximum hp.
- You instantly die if a stake is shoved through your heart while at 0 hitpoints
- You instantly die if a clove of garlic is shoved down your throat while at 0
hitpoints
- Although you do not require conventional food or drink, you crave some sort of
life essence (Blood, Souls, Life Energy, Etc.) and you will begin to slowly
starve if you do not consume an amount (agreed upon with your keeper) of these 
things often. after 30 days without your life essence of choice you lose one 
maximum hitpoint per day until you reach 0 hitpoints, when you instantly die and 
turn to dust.
- You have a natural aversion to holy symbols and must make a DC 14 wisom saving
throw or be frightened for 1 minute when a holy symbol is presented to you. 
You are immune to the offending holy symbol's effects for 1 hour if you pass. On
a fail you may repeat the save at the end of each of your turns 
(every 6 seconds)
- Silver burns your skin, this does not do any damage to your hitpoints but does
leave a noticable mark that others can see which fades after a week.
- Every 6 seconds you spend in direct sunlight you take 1d8 radiant damage.
- You have disadvantage on perception checks to see things in direct sunlight.

### Vampiric Form
When accursed with vampirism you gain a specialized form, choose one from Noble, 
Daywalker, or Feral. This form determines certain strengths and weaknesses.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d8+CON.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d8+CON.

### Hit point re-roll
Now, and again each time you gain a level from now on, you recalculate your hit
points. Roll 3d8 and add your CON modifier three times. If the value rolled is
higher than your current max hit points, you may keep it.

#### Vampiric Resistance
You have resistance to non-magical and non-silvered slashing, piercing, and 
bludgeoning and immunity to necrotic and poison damage. 

### Extra atack
In addition to any attacks you would normally make when you use the attack
action, you may make one additional attack.

## Vampiric Forms

### Noble
You are the face of vampirism, the blood sucking baron who secludes themself to 
their massive mansion. Well mannered and well liked, nobles focus on grace and 
charm rather than massive strength. 

#### Weaknesses.
Due to your vampiric form you gain the following weaknesses.  
- You must get consent from the residents of an abode before being able to enter.

#### Shapechanging
As an action you may change shapes to a cloud of mist, a bat, or back to your 
true form; Your equipment transforms with you and is unusable while not in your 
true form. As a cloud of mist you are capable of passing through gaps as small 
as one inch wide and you have a flying speed of 30 feet and may dash as a bonus
action, you are not capable of making attacks in this form. As a bat your stats 
are identical to a mundate bat (aside from mental stats) You have a flying speed
of 50 feet and are size tiny.

#### Supernatural Charm
You gain proficiency in Deception and Persuasion.

#### (Level 2)

#### (Level 4)

#### (Level 7)


### Daywalker
One of the rarer types of vampire, daywalkers sacrifice strength for function 
and discipline. Apex predators of day and night, daywalkers often become vampire
hunters or take on jobs which make them highly valuable to non-vampire societies.

#### Weaknesses.
Due to your vampiric form you gain the following weaknesses.

- You must consume life essence from a willing victim.
- You physically age, although it is at 1/10th the rate of a normal person of 
your body type.
- You lose your claw attack and your teeth are no longer retractable

#### Demivampirism
Due to the fact you are a daywalker you lose certain weaknesses associated with
vampirism. You do not have an aversion to holy symbols, you do not have 
disadvantage on perception checks to view things in direct sunlight, and you do
not take radiant damage from being in direct sunlight.

#### By Any Means Necessary 
Your lack of claws leads you to more resourceful means of combat, you gain 
proficiency in improvised and martial weapons and you are capable of making an
improvised weapon out of items on the ground as an action.

#### (Level 2)

#### (Level 4)

#### (Level 7)


### Feral
The rarest form of vampire, ferals are plagued by uncontrollable bloodlust and
use this drive to heighten their normal battle ability to unbridaled levels of 
savagery. Either constantly giving into their desires or sworn off of them, 
feral vampires are a force of nature, and not one to be taken lightly.

#### Weaknesses.
Due to your vampiric form you gain the following weaknesses.

- You have an extreme craving for life essence, regardless of whether you need
to consume it or not.
- When not transformed you have disadvantage on strength checks
- When not transformed your bite attacks deal 1d6 piercing damage and your claw
attacks deal 1d4 slashing damage
- While transformed High pitched sounds are extremely overstimulating to you. 
When exposed to a high pitch sound make a DC 12 constitution saving throw, on a 
failure you are stunned for 6 seconds as you cup your ears and fall to the 
ground in an attempt to dampen the noise.


#### Feral Transformation
As a bonus action you may expend and roll up to 5 stamina dice and add those 
rolls to your maximum and current hitpoints as you turn into a batlike 
form. When you enter your feral form you grow one size larger and gain advantage
on Dexterity and Constitution checks, you gain 10 feet of walking speed and 40 
feet of flying speed, Your bite attack damage becomes a d10, and your claw 
attack damage becomes a d8. Provided you have consumed a necessary amount of 
your life essence of choice, you return to your normal form after an hour and 
may end the transformation early as a bonus action. If an hour elapses or you 
choose to end the transformation early before you have consumed a necessary 
amount of  life essence you must succeed a DC 16 wisdom saving throw or enter an 
uncontrollable state until you enconter and feed on a source of life essence.

#### Undying Hunger
Although you have most of the same physiology of other vampires, you require 
much more frequent feeding sessions to upkeep your feral form. After going 7 
days without consuming your life essence of choice you must succeed a DC 12 
wisdom saving throw every night at midnight or undergo an uncontrolled 
transformation into your feral form 
(as if you expended the maximum avaliable amount of stamina dice) and seek 
out a source of sustenance. you may repeat the wisdom saving throw every minute
after the uncontrolled transformation begins, regaining control of 
yourself on a success. Although you heavily crave life essence, you do not 
actually require it to live and suffer no ill effects other than mental strain 
if you go without.

#### (Level 2)

#### (Level 4)

#### (Level 7)

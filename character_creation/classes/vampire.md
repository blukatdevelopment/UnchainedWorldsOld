## Features

### Vampirism
Due to circumstances that may or may not have been beyond your control you have
been accursed with vampirism. You gain the following benefits and drawbacks.

Benefits:
- You cannot be outright killed unless through one of the specified means.
- When reduced to 0 hitpoints or below you do not have to roll hit dice to avoid
death, instead you simply enter an unconcious state where you regain hitpoints
over the course of 8 hours, awaking with full hitpoints after the time has 
elapsed. this process takes only 5 minutes in moonlight.
- You gain a bite and a claw unarmed attack, the teeth and claws used for these 
attacks are retractible at will. Your claw attack deals 1d6+Dexterity or 
Strength slashing damage, you may make an additonal strike with your claws if
your first attack on your turn hits. Your bite attack deals 1d8+Strength or 
Constitution piercing damage, if you hit with a bite attack you may choose to 
either regain hitpoints equal to half the damage delt (Provided the target is
not a construct) or add half the damage delt to your next attack roll.
- You gain 10 additional feet of walking and climbing speed.
- You do not need to eat, drink, or sleep.

Drawbacks:
- You are outright killed if you take damage of the radiant or fire damage type
equal to or greater than 2 times your maximum hp.
- You instantly die if a stake is shoved through your heart while at 0 hitpoints
- You instantly die if a clove of garlic is shoved down your throat while at 0
hitpoints
- Although you do not require conventional food or drink, you crave some sort of
life essence (Blood, Souls, Life Energy, Etc.) and you will begin to slowly
starve if you do not consume an appropriate amount of these things often. after 
30 days without your life essence of choice you lose one maximum hitpoint per 
day until you reach 0 hitpoints when you instantly die and turn to dust.
- You have a natural aversion to holy symbols and must make a DC 14 wisom saving
throw or be frightened when a holy symbol is presented to you. You are immune to
the offending holy symbol's effects for 1 hour if you pass.
- Silver burns your skin, this does not do any damage to your hitpoints but does
leave a noticable mark that others can see which fades after a week.

### Vampiric Form
When accursed with vampirism you gain a specialized form, choose one from Noble, 
Daywalker, or Feral. This form determines certain strengths and weaknesses.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d6+CON.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d6+CON.

### Hit point re-roll
Now, and again each time you gain a level from now on, you recalculate your hit
points. Roll 3d6 and add your CON modifier three times. If the value rolled is
higher than your current max hit points, you may keep it.

#### Vampiric Resistance
You have resistance to non-magical and non-silvered slashing, piercing, and
immunity to necrotic and poison damage. 

### Extra atack
In addition to any attacks you would normally make when you use the attack
action, you may make one additional attack.

## Vampiric Forms

### Noble
You are the face of vampirism, the blood sucking baron who secludes themself to 
their massive mansion. Well mannered and well liked, nobles focus on grace and 
charm rather than massive strength. 

Weaknesses: 
- Every 6 seconds you spend in direct sunlight you take 1d8 radiant 
damage. 
- You must get consent from the residents of an abode before being able to enter.

#### Shapechanging
As an action you may change shapes to a cloud of mist, a bat, or back to your 
true form; Your equipment transforms with you and is unusable while not in your 
true form. As a cloud of mist you are capable of passing through gaps as small 
as one inch wide and you have a flying speed of 30 feet and may dash as a bonus
action, you are not capable of making attacks in this form. As a bat your stats 
are identical to a mundate bat (aside from mental stats) You have a flying speed
of 50 feet and are size tiny.

#### Supernatural Charm
You gain proficiency in Deception and Persuasion. 

### Daywalker


### Feral

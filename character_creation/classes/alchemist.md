## Features

### Novice Alchemy
You learn to brew simple potions using the Amateur's Bubbling Cauldron 
technique. During each partial or full rest, you may spend 5SP of alchemical
ingredients to brew a potion using a known technique. You may brew a number
of potions equal to your intelligence modifier during that rest. You may use
a separate alchemy technique for each potion. In addition to making potions,
you may use your alchemy kit to identify a potion. Doing so requires 10 minutes.

### Lesser Splash Potions
You learn to temporarily heighten the potency of a potion so that it can be
divided up between two bottles. The process requires one action and consumes
one hit die to fuel the magic, but results in two potions. These potions remain
potent for 1 minute, after which they lose all potency.

### Big Dipper
Your practice has paid off. You may now dip a weapon or piece of ammunition in
a potion using your bonus action.

### Journeyman Alchemy
Above and beyond simply making potions, you've learned to refine your technique
by using additives to avoid defects and increse the potency of your potions.
You may add 5SP of extra alchemical ingredients to a potion and add 1d6 to your
roll for that potion. If your roll is higher than the values in the table, you
pick the highest value in the table.

### Glassblower
You may now craft 1d12 flasks or 1d4 vials during a partial or long rest at a
campfire. You may instead produce a single glass arrow, which can be filled with
any potion and fired from a shortbow or longbow.

### Expert Alchemy
You have further refined your use of additives to better control the output
of brewing. When you make a potion, you may now include additives in order to
roll multiple times for your technique and pick one of the rolls. Below is a
chart of the total number of rolls and cost in ingredients.
```
+-------+------+
| Rolls | Cost |
+-------+------+
|     2 | 1GP  |
|     4 | 5GP  |
|     6 | 10GP |
+-------+------+
```

### Greater Splash Potions
When you create splash potions, you may now produce four from a single potion,
instead of two.

### Master Alchemy
You have gained mastery over the field of alchemy. You have learned to copy
existing potions, whether they are products of any known techniques or not.
When making a batch of potions during a partial or full rest, you may expend
a potion to copy it. Doing this requires 10GP of ingredients per potion.

### The Drunken Chaotician (minimum level 4)
This produces a potion of chaos each and every time.

## Potions

### Rat Spit Spirit
This clear liquid smells strongly of turpentine. If thrown, it creates a puddle
that fits inside a 5 foot square. When thrown at a creature, it breaks on
impact and soaks them. Lighting the spirit with fire damage or tinder box causes
the the spirit to ignite in blue flame, dealing 2d10 fire damage

### Hunter Bomb
This bottle of dark, licorice-smelling liquid comes with a much smaller vial
of effervescent sweet liquid. When mixed, the substance becomes highly unstable.
If the bottle is not thrown within one minute of mixing, it will explode.
If thrown at a creature within 30 feet, it will cause an explosion of fire that
expands outwards in a 15 foot sphere, causing every creature inside to make
a DC 15 dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 3d6 fire damage, or
half on a success.

### Invisible Brandy
When you shake the bottle, it sloshes, but you swear you can see nothing inside.
Do not try to sell this without letting the buyer shake it for themself.
If you drink this potion, you become invisible for one minute.

### Amaro Guarire
This pungent, dark liquid is bitter tasting and supposedly good for your health.
When you consume it, you gain 3d10 hit points and make a DC 14 constitution
saving throw. On a failure, you gain one level of exhaustion.

### Speech Bubble Tea
Filled with tapioca pearls, this fruity drink bestows powerful hallucinations.
After consuming this potion from it's thick straw, you can see speech bubbles
with written words on them every time someone speaks. You can differentiate
voices in a crowd this way, and if someone speaks a language you do not know,
the symbols for that language still appear, allowing you to write them down
for later translation. If you watch from a distance of up to 300 feet, the
speech bubbles will grow and be easy for you to read. Past that no speech
bubbles appear. This lasts for 1d4 hours.

### Poisoner's Perfume
This bright pink liquid carries a strong floral aroma similar to roses. As good
as it smells, it has high concentrations of cyanide and arsenic. The poison
tastes slightly bitter to the touch, and if consumed will deal 5d10 poison
damage. You may dip up to ten pieces of ammunition in this perfume, or pour
half the bottle out onto a melee weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage.
The coating lasts for one minute, and the first attack with a coated weapon
deals an extra 2d10 poison damage if it hits.

### Tekilya
A dead worm sits at the bottom of this extremely bitter spirit. If you drink
it, you gain 3d8 maximum hit points for 1 minute. At the end of the duration,
your maximum hit point returns to normal and you take 3d8 poison damage.

### Ethereal Liquer
When you look into this potion, you can faintly see tiny glowing dots swimming
around in it. Drinking this potion causes you to phase into the ethereal plane
for 1 hour, after which you ate returned to your previous plane of existence.
Make a DC 14 constitution saving throw. On a failure, you are tipsy.

### Smelling salt soup
This potion requires an carrot and potato to stew, and is a full meal in itself.
If someone is unconscious or making death saving throws, splashing them with
this liquid causes them to awaken with 1 hit point.

### Cloud in a bottle
This bottle of black liquid is activated by dropping a pinch of reagent power
in. When you activate this potion, pressure begins to build in the bottle.
If you wait for 1 minute, the bottle will build pressure and explode wherever
it is. You may instead throw the potion up to a range of 40 feet, setting off
the potion on impact. In either case, the potion creates a dark storm cloud
that fills a 20 foot cube. The cloud provides makes any creatures inside or
behind it heavily obscured. The cloud lasts for 1 hour. Throwing salt into the
cloud will cause it to darken and discharge lightning. Every creature inside
the cloud at this time must make a dex saving throw. On a failure they take 2d6
lightning damage. On a success, they take half as much. The cloud then
disappears.

### Spark Fruit Cocktail
This yellow liquid has a strong citrus smell and gives off a static discharge
occassionally. This potion tastes refreshingly sweet and fruity. Drinking it
allows you to conjure static electricity from your hands for one minute. In that
time, any unarmed melee attacks and weapon attacks with a metal weapon confer
an additional 1d6 lightning damage.

### Thorned Potion
A thorn floats in some light green liquid. It tastes strongly of grass clippings
and humus. For the next minute thorny vines sprout from your arms and you may
use the thorn whip cantrip, found in the Spell Compendium Volume 1.

### Bullseye light potion
After consuming this potion, your insides glow brightly. If you open your mouth,
you produce bright light for 60 feet, and dim light for 60 more feet in a narrow
area. Your nostrils glow faintly, giving away your position in darkness.

### Awkward Healing Potion
The scent changes depending on who drinks this clear liquid. Some smell lemon,
while others smell rotting eggs or fresh watermelon. It's utterly awkward to see
the effect this potion has when poured on the ground in a crowd. Fortunately
the flavor is that of pure water. Consuming this potion heals 1d4 hit points.

### Mundane Strength Potion
This potion is grey, scentless, and flavorless. When consumed, your muscles
grow. Your strength modifier increases by +2 for the next minute.

### Thick Skin Potion
Shake well, as this potion tends to grow large waxy chunks if left on the shelf
for long. When you drink this potion, your hide grows tough and you gain +2
AC for the next minute.

### Strong Acid
The symbol for this potion is a flexing arm, but that's entirely misleading.
You can use a strong acid for many things, but it can be thrown up to 20 feet.
On a hit, the target is burned by this dark green fluid and receives 3d6 acid
damage.

### Super solvent
All glue, paint, and dye that comes into contact with this substances is dissolved immediately. It is also slippery, and can be used to slick up smooth surfaces. Super solvent is completely safe to the touch, making it useful for applications where damage is not desired. Do not consume super solvent. Aside from it's bitter taste,
consuming it will cause the creature that consumed it to become poisoned for 1 hour, during which they will experience nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach,
and diarrhea;

### Insane Adhesive
This adhesive may join two objects together and withstand a force of 200 pounds. Once it has adhered, only super solvent or a strong acid can dissolve insane adhesive. If thrown on the ground, it creates a 5 foot by 5 foot puddle that lasts for one minute. Any large or smaller creature that steps on this puddle must succeed a DC 16 strength save, or their movement is reduced to 0. They may use their action to make this save again.

### Glow paint
This liquid, once spattered on a target, will illuminate them and allow them to be targeted in complete darkness as if in bright light. The paint can also be used to mark walls. An entire flask of glow paint can be shattered on the ground to create a 10 foot square. If a creature steps on this square, they can be targeted by spells that require sight, and can be targeted by normal attacks as if in dim light. An invisible creature that steps in a puddle will produce glowing footprints that can be tracked, allowing attacks to target them with disadvantage.

### Growth paint
A creature coated in this paint will grow two sizes larger. This effect lasts for one hour. In such a state, damage from weapon attacks increases by 1d4. One jar has two uses, or one if thrown when full. If the creature is trapped in a confined space when they are grown, they will receive 4d8 bludgeoning damage and be restrained for the duration.

### Potion of shrinking
A creature coated in this paint will shrink down by two sizes. In such a state, damage from weapon attacks decreases by 1d4 to a minimum of 1 damage. The effect lasts for one hour.

### Potion of chaos
When one consumes this potion, they roll a 1d20 and receive the corresponding effect:
1. Become poisoned, receive 1d20 poison damage
2. Receive 1d20 poison damage
3. For the next 1d4 days, you will cough up demonic larvae at night
4. You produce radioactive flatulance. Every creature within 30ft of you must make a DC 17 con save, receiving 2d8 radiant damage on failure and half as much on success
5. You contract malignant lycanthropy
6. You can only communicate through song for the next 1d4 hours
7. You begin to perceive the sounds of plants screaming in pain when stepped on or eaten for the next 1d4 hours.
8. For the next 1d4 days, the tears you produce can cure any infection or curse.
9. Your hair falls out, then regrows in a new color. 1d4 (red, green, blue, white)
10. You experience mitosis, splitting into two exact copies of your original self.
11. A devil appears from a portal, ready to make a magical contract with you.
12. For the next 1d4 days, you are transformed into a random animal. 1d10(frog, mouse, owl, cat, fox, dog, bat, bear, lizard, cow)
13. Your voice booms. You can be faintly heard from one mile when speaking, and when you shout, all creatures within 100 feet must make a DC 15 con saving throw or take 1d20 thunder damage. Creatures may use a reaction to drop whatever's in their hands and cover their ears to give themselves advantage on such a check.
14. You sprout claws and sharp teeth for the next 1d4 hours, and your unarmed attacks with them deal 1d6+strength damage.
15. Your sense of smell increases, granting you 20 feet of blind sight for the next 1d4 hours.
16. For the next 1d4 hours, you can see sounds, effectively doubling your hearing range.
17. Your eyes charge up a beam(use wisdom for the attack roll) which deals 2d8 radiant damage on a hit.
18. A swarm of angry bees emerges from your nostrils, mouth, and ears. It may attack one creature within 30 feet +8 to hit and deal 2d8 poison damage on a hit.
19. Heal 3d8 health
20. Remove one harmful effect on you and heal 3d8 health

### Doppelganger's brew
When you drop a physical piece of a medium or small-sized creature into this
liquid, it fizzles and froths, activating. Drinking the brew will cause you 
to transform to be physically identical to that creature. You remain this way
for 1d4 days, unless your hit points are reduced to or below 0.

### Light Beer
This evervescent amber liquid tastes strongly of hopps and yeast, and causes
mild belching. For 1d4 hours, your feel nearly weightless. This grants you the
ability to jump thirty feet into the air, and grants a climbing speed equal to
your movement speed. You fall at a rate of 5 feet per six seconds, and do not
take fall damage.

### Beast folk's Ale
This dark, bitter liquid has a powerful odor of wet fur. You may add the hair,
feather, mucus, or scale of one beast to activate the potion. Drinking the
concoction will transform you into a beast folk version of this beast for the
next 1d4 days. Alternatively, you may instead add one drop of your blood to
activate the potion. When activated with blood, it is only effective for the
creature whose blood was added, the animal is selected randomly, and the effect
is permanent.
Roll a 1d10
1. Field Mouse
2. Long-eared Bunny
3. Arctic Fox
4. Timber Wolf
5. Black Bear
6. Bald Eagle
7. Bullfrog
8. Salmon
9. Mountain Lion
10. Bison

### Devil's Liquor
This blood-red liquid is always warm to the touch. When you drink it, your skin
turns the same shade of crimson, you grow a spade tail, and horns grow from your
head. Unarmed attacks with your horns deal 1d8 piercing damage.  Wings sprout
from your back, granting you a 30 foot flying speed. In addition, you gain sight
in pure darkness up to 120 feet as your eyes grow completely black. You may create
magical contracts with willing creatures that will last after the effects of this
potion end. The potion lasts 1d4 days, and at the end your hit points drop to 0
and you begin rolling death saving throws. On three successes, you awaken 1d4 hours
later in your prior form. If you instead accumulate three failures, you awaken
1d4 hours later permanently transformed as a devil.

### Stone Skin Syrup
This thick, smokey, sweet concoction causes your skin to turn to stone. For the
next minute, you are resistant to all non-magical physical damage.

### Dragon Salsa
A chunky mixture of stewwed peppers, tomatoes, and spices, dragon salsa serves 
as a full meal. The default element is fire, but you may add an extra ingredient
to change the element. Iron dust grants lightning, lemon grants acid, some mint
for cold, and a small piece of nightshade plant grants poison. For the next
minute after consuming a jar of the salsa, you may perform a breath attack. You 
create a 15 foot cone of breath. All creatres within must make a DC 15 dexterity
saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the element you selected, or half as much on
a save.

### Necromancer's Pickle Brine
If you listen carefully, you can hear whispering coming from this salty, sour
liquid. Submerging a dead tiny creature or a severed limb along with a hair from
your body in a jar of this fluid for one day will cause the creature to 
re-animate as an undead version of itself. It shares your turn in initiative. 
When it's within 100 feet of you, you can use your bonus action to command the 
creature to move up to 30 feet and make and attack(+5, 1d4 piercing on hit). 
It has 8 AC and 1 hit point.

### Skillfull Spirit
This clear liquid can take the paint off a wall, and it burns the whole way
down. A flask of the stuff has ten charges. When you take a shot of this spirit,
you receive advantage on the next skillcheck you make within 1 minute.
Make a con save, DC 14. If you fail, you become intoxicated.

### The Tremendous Gulp
This flask of sugary fluid produces a powerful rush. For the next 1d10 turns,
your movement speed doubles, you gain an extra action, and your AC increases by
+5. When the potion wears off, powerful side-effects set in. Side effects
include reduced vision, halved movement speed, and disadvantage on all attack
rolls.

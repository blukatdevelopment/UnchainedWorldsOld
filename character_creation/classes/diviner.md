| Cantrip     |          25 |

|:------------|:------------|
```

#### Preparing Spells
Before you sleep at night, you may perform a prayer to request a number of spells equal to half your diviner level (rounded down) plus your wisdom modifier,  minimum of one spell. You may select these spells from the  diviner spell list, and they must be first level or higher. You may only cast spells that you have prepared.

#### Piety
A deity provides your source of magic, and so your fuel for spellcasting is piety. Your actions are judged, providing and revoking piety. If your balance of piety ever falls below zero, you lose all all divine spellcasting and magical abilities. You cannot cast a spell if you do not have enough piety to do so.

### Channel Divinity
As the discipline in your domain grows solid, your deity offers up a domain-specific ability.
Using channel divinity uses an action and expends 5 stamina dice.

#### Holy Light (Solus)
You outstretch your arms and a 60 foot diameter cylinder that extends from the  sky to your feet illuminates it's space as if in bright daylight. The light crosses through solid objects and may penetrate into subterranean spaces. Creatures cannot hide within the light, and invisible creatures become visible. Any friendly creatures within the light are immune to necrotic damage and any enemy creatures within the light are vulnerable to radiant damage. The light lasts for 1 minute.

#### Miasma of Restoration (Coent)
You call out the name of your deity and smoke rolls out of your nostrils, ears, and mouth. A 15 foot radius cloud forms around you and heavily obscures visibility. Any creature which begins it's turn within or enters the cloud is healed for 1d6 hit points. You may use an action each turn to sustain the cloud. The effect lasts up to 1 minute.

#### Spirit Bomb (Gegtix)
You hold your hands with wrists touching and call out to the spirits of nature to lend you their energy. An orb of spirit energy forms in front of your hands as you siphon the collective energy of the plants and animals on your plane of existence. Now, and until this effect ends, you may choose to build or release the channeled energy.

You may release the spirit bomb by firing it at a point within 120 feet, The orb explodes on impact and all creatures within a 30ft range must make a dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 radiant damage on a failure and half as much on a success. Within the point of impact any metal objects degrade into piles of rust powder. This ends the channel divinity.

You may build the channeled energy further and consuming 2 more stamina dice, growing the orb. The radius when you release the spirit bomb increases by 5ft, and the damage dealt increases by 2d8, up to a maximum of 50ft and 10d8 radiant damage. You must hold concentration to build the spirit bomb's energy.

#### Omniscient Sight (Yxheia)
Your eyes begin to glow brightly. You can see all creatures within 120 feet of you, whether they are invisible, hiding, or in a parallel dimension such as the ethereal plane. You chant a holy prayer, and any friendly creatures within range share this sight, and additionally gain advantage on any attack rolls they make. Each turn, you may use your bonus action to continue chanting in order to extend this effect for up to 1 minute.

#### Reap (Korrath)
You use one hand to point at an evil creature within 60 feet, and hold your other hand in the air as you declare that the creature will be reaped in the name of Korrath. A spectral scythe appears in your hand. You are proficient with the scythe and it uses wisdom instead of strength. The scythe deals 3d10 force damage on a hit. If you kill the targeted creature, their soul is harvested and you receive 1d2 * 1000 piety. The weapon disappears after 1 minute, or if you end a turn without having attacked with it, or after killing the targeted creature.

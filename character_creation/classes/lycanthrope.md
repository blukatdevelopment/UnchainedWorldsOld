## Features

### Lycanthrope Form
Choose from werewolf, wererat, or werebear, which is the form that you assume
each time you shift. While shifting, your body grows and stretches, transforming
into a lycanthrope. While in your lycanthrope form, your stamina die's size changes
according to your form. The werewolf has a D10, the wererat D8, and the werebear
D12. Whether the shift is controlled or not, you may expend one or more stamina
dice, rolling them and adding this amount to your current and maximum hit points
. When you shift ends and you rleave your lycanthrope form, your maximum hit
points return to their normal amount and your hit points are reduced to 1.

#### Uncontrolled shifting
There are certain triggers that may cause you to involuntarily enter your
lycanthrope form. When you experience one of these triggers, you must make a
wisdom save against it's DC(indicated in the Uncontrolled shift triggers table).
You may expend a stamina die to remake the throw. If you fail this check, you
involuntarily enter your lycanthrope form. During an uncontrolled shift, you may
remake the wisdom saving throw once each minute. While uncontrolled, the GM, or
someone designated by them takes control of your character, applying logic from
the uncontrolled shift behavior flowchart. If you succeed the check, you are
immune to being triggered for the next hour.

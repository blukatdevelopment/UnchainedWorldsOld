## Training Montage
You have survived long enough as a commoner. Remove all your stamina dice and 
retain any proficiencies and equipment. You lose all levels in commoner. Choose 
a class other than commoner. You are now level 1 in the chosen class. Your 
current hit points are kept in addition to whatever your new class provides.

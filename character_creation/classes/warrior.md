## Features

### Warrior's Respite
An army marches on it's belly, and you are no different. You may consume a 2lb
quantity of food over the course of 10 minutes and expend one stamina die. Roll
the expended die and gain that many temporary hit points, which last until you
complete a rest.

### Maneuver
You learn one maneuver from the warrior maneuvers list. The maneuvers column
shows the number of maneuvers you know at any given level.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d10+CON.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d10+CON.

### Hit point re-roll
Now, and again each time you gain a level from now on, you recalculate your hit
points. Roll 3d4 and add your CON modifier three times. If the value rolled is
higher than your current max hit points, you may keep it.

### Extra Attack
When you use your action to make an attack, you may make two attacks instead.

### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

## Warrior Maneuvers

### Frenzy
As a reaction when you take damage during combat, you may enter a frenzy.
In a frenzy you are resistant to slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage.
You also have advantage on athletics and strength saving throws while in a
frenzy. Your frenzy ends after one minute, or when you begin your turn without
taking damage or making an attack in the previous round of combat. When your
frenzy ends, you receive one level of exhaustion. During a frenzy you ignore
all levels of exhaustion.

### Stagger Block
As a reaction when a melee weapon attack misses you by 2 or less, you can block
the attack with brute force and stagger the attacker. The attacker must succeed
a strength saving throw with a DC equal to your passive strength. On a failure,
they are staggered, and the next attack against them has advantage until the
start of their next turn.

### Forced Strike
When your melee weapon attack misses by 2 or less, you may use your bonus action
to lock weapons with the targeted creature, and you make a contested athletics
check. If you succeed, you force your weapon against their block and deal half
damage.

### Reckless Strike
When you make the first attack on your turn, you may do so fiercely and without
regard for your own safety. When you do, you gain advantage on that attack
roll. Until the start of your next turn, attacks made against you have
advantage.

### Charge
When you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attacking, your next
attack deals an additional 1d8 damage if it hits.

### Swift Action
At the beginning of your turn you may fully utilize your swiftness in battle
to perform two actions instead of one. When you do so, you must expend one
stamina die. You may only use this ability once per turn.

### Deflect Attack
If a melee attack would hit by 2 or less, you may use your reaction to deflect
the attack.

### Violent Grapple Break
When a creature fails an attempted grapple on you, you may make an attack
against them.

### Zealous Strike
When a creature enters your attack range, you may use your reaction to make an
attack against them.

### Second Wind
You may use your bonus action to take a deep breath and brace yourself for more
carnage. You must have at least one stamina die, which you expend by rolling.
You heal the rolled amount of hit points.

### Danger Sense
You may use your reaction to confer advantage on a dexterity saving throw
when you can see or hear the source of danger.

### Fighting Will
You may use your bonus action to expend one of your stamina dice and roll it.
You gain that much temporary hit points. Until the start of your next turn,
any attack you make receives advantage.

### Action Surge
You may now expend a stamina die take one additional action this turn. You may
only use action surge once per turn.

### Enduring Will (minimum level 9)
If you roll initiative and have no stamina dice remaining, you regain one.

### Last stand (minimum level 9)
When you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and doesn't kill you
outright, you may use your reaction to expend all of your stamina dice and
remain standing with 1 hit point.

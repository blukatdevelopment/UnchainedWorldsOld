## Features

### Tricks
You know 2 tricks, and you learn more as you gain levels, according to the
tricks column.

### Thieve's Cant
Your thieving lifestyle has lead you to learn the language thieves use to
communicate by subtle gestures and markings left on buildings and objects. You
may use these to locate criminal contacts.

### Expertise
Choose one skill that you have proficiency with. Your proficiency bonus counts
twice for checks made with this skill. You may substitute this skill proficiency
for proficiency with thieve's tools.

### Ability Score increase
You may increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores
of your choice by 1. You cannot increase an ability score past 20.

## Thief Tricks

### Trickster's Arcana
You know the Lesser Telekinesis cantrip from the spell compendium volume 1. You
may expend a hit die to cast this spell. 

### Improvised Shield
If you hold an item such as a thick book, a bar stool, or table, you may use it
to block an attack. You receive a +2 bonus to your AC. If the attack roll is
only 1 or 2 lower than your AC, the item takes damage from the attack, and might
be destroyed.

### Distracting Phrase
When a creature is about to make an attack, you may expend a hit die and
use your reaction to call it's attention to you and away from the attack,
granding that attack disadvantage.

### Distraction Toss
You use your action to hurl an object weighing 20lb or more at a medium
creature, which may use it's reaction to catch, dodge, or deflect the object. If
it does not, make an athletics check. The amount rolled is the DC for a strength
saving throw that it must succeed, or will fall prone. Until the start of the
creature's next turn, the first attack made against it has advantage due to this
distraction.

### Pocket Sand
You may expend your hit die to throw pocket sand at one creature within 5ft of
you. The creature may use it's reaction to make a DC 14 dexterity saving throw.
If it fails or does not make the save, it is blinded until the start of your
next turn.

### Second-Story Work
You gain a climbing speed equal to half your movement speed.
Fall damage from 20 feet or less is halved for you.

### Fast Hands
You may now use your bonus action to perform sleight of hand checks, use your
thieves' tools to disarm a trap, open a lock, or take the Use An Object action.

### Fast Feet
You consume a hit die to unlock hidden stamina. Adrenaline pumps through your
veins and you feel faster than normal. For this turn, your speed doubles.

### Slippery
When you begin your turn grappled and you are wearing a coat, cloak, or other
similarly loose garment, you may use your free object interaction to slip out
of the garment, exiting the grapple in the process. The grappler will be left
holding your garment.

### Cower
You drop to your knees, surrender, and beg for mercy. Each creature that knows
at least one language must make a wisdom saving throw. Make a performance check,
which is the DC. On a failure, the creature's attacks against you have
disadvantage, and the first attack you make while cowering has advantage if it
targets them.

### Reactive Dodge (Minimum level 3)
When an attack targets you, you may now use your reaction to give that attack
disadvantage.

### Defensive Acrobatics (Minimum level 3)
When you are targeted by a ranged or melee attack, you may use your reaction to
perform a somersault, backflip, cartwheel, or other acrobatic maneuver to avoid
damage. Make an acrobatics check. If you roll equal or higher than the attack,
the attack misses. If you roll lower, you instead fall prone before the attack
takes place.

### Dart Deliverer (Minimum level 3)
You now have advantage on attack rolls made with darts.

### Vice (Minimum Level 4)
Whether it's food, drink, or something else entirely, you indulge in a vice.
You may indulge in this vice for 1 minute in order to restore a hit die. Once
you use this ability, you may not use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Cunning Action (Minimum level 4)
You may use your bonus action to perform the Dash, Dodge, Disengage, or Hide
actions.

### Trip (Minimum level 4)
When you make an attack of opportunity, you may first make a contested check to
attempt to trip the creature. Use your acrobatics against their
athletics. If they are larger than you, they have advantage on their check. If
you succeed, the creature falls prone.

### Trickster's Advanced Arcana (Minimum level 6)
You know the Vorpal Snare and Catapult spells from the spell compendium volume
1. You may cast either of these spells by consuming two hit dice.

### Superior Sneak (Minimum level 6)
You gain advantage on a stealth check if you have moved no more than half your
speed on the same turn.

### Cloak and Dagger (Minimum level 6)
You know how to draw a blade quickly and covertly on an unsuspecting enemy.
When you have nothing in your hands and have not attacked yet in combat, you may
use your action to draw a dagger and perform a melee or thrown attack with it.
You have advantage on this attack.

### Dagger Throwing Expertise (Minimum level 6)
When you throw a dagger for the first time on your turn, it deals critical
damage on a hit.

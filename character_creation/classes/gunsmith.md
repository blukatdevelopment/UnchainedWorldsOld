## Features

### Gunsmith Maneuvers
You learn to perform maneuvers from the maneuvers list. The number of maneuvers
you know can be found in the list of the maneuvers column.

### Scrap
One unit of scrap consists of 10lb of iron, chemicals, and other metal. It can
be purchased from most shops for 1GP. During a rest, you may
break down metal items into scrap. When you break down a batch of metal items,
divide the total weight by 10 to find the number scrap units you get. The
remainder is wasted.

### Smith
During a partial or full rest, you may craft weapons using scrap.
You may not craft cartridges, nor weapons that use cartridges.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d6+CON.

### Hit point Increase
Your maximum hit points increase by 1d6+CON.

### Hit point re-roll
Now, and again each time you gain a level from now on, you recalculate your hit
points. Roll 3d6 and add your CON modifier three times. If the value rolled is
higher than your current max hit points, you may keep it.

### Second Wind
You may use your bonus action to take a deep breath and brace yourself for more
carnage. You must have at least one stamina die, which you expend by rolling.
You heal the rolled amount of hit points.

### Advanced Smith
You may now craft cartridges and weapons that use cartridges.

## Maneuvers

### Humanoid shield
When you grapple a creature and are targeted by a ranged weapon or spell attack,
you may use your reaction to add +5 to your AC for the purpose of that attack.
If the attack would have otherwise hit you, the grappled creature receives this
hit instead.

### Execution
When you are within 5ft of an enemy that does not see you, your expertise with
gunning allows you to aim to kill. You may make a ranged weapon attack without
receiveving disadvantage from close range. If this attack hits, you deal an
additional 3d8 damage.

### Spray and Pray
If firing a weapon with the reload property, you may use your action to make
up to three ranged attacks in place of one. Each attack has disadvantage.

### Suppressing fire
You use a weapon with at least five shots left in it to lay down suppressing
fire. Target a 10 foot cube in range. You fire five times into this area until
the start of your next turn. A creature that starts its turn in this cube or
enters it for the first time must succeed a DC 15 wisdom saving throw or fall
prone and end its turn. If a creature succeeds the saving throw and moves in
your line of sight, you may target it with one of your 5 shots. This attack has
disadvantage, but forces the creature to remake the wisdom saving throw even
if it misses.

### Fire around cover
You've learned to blindly fire from behind cover. When you are behind cover
from an enemy, you may hold your weapon out of cover and attack with it. When
doing so, you receive a -5 to your attack roll. Making an attack this way does
not expose you to enemy ranged attacks.

### Disarming shot
You're as precise as you are quick. If an enemy is holding an item of any kind
in one hand, you may target the item in their hand, incurring a -5 penalty to
your attack roll when you do so. On a hit, the target lets go of the item. If
it is not attached to them in some way, it falls to the ground.

### Called shot
You target a specific body part such as a leg, arm, hand, or eye. At the DM's
discretion, this attack receives either a -2 or -5 penalty to the attack roll.
On a hit, your damage is applied directly to that body part. This may effect
a creature's mobility, senses, or deal an additional 1d8 damage by targeting
a vital body part.

### Quick draw
If you are targeted by a ranged weapon attack and your hands are empty, you may
use your reaction to draw a holstered one-handed ranged weapon and make a ranged
weapon attack with it. You may not quick draw weapons that are already drawn, or
that are not in a holster of some sort.

### Steady Aim
You're good at getting the most out of long barrels. With any two-handed
ranged weapon, you may use your bonus action to aim carefully. Doing so grants
your next shot this turn advantage.

### Dual-wielding
You've learned to wield ranged weapons with both hands. The weapons must be
one-handed, but do not require the light property. If one or more of the weapons
have the reloading property, you must use an action on the next turn to reload
both weapons. You may store or draw two of such weapons at the same time.

### Trigger Guard Catch
When a blade(dagger, shortsword, longsword, rapier) targets you with an attack
that would hit, you may use your reaction to gain +2 AC for the purpose of this
attack by catching the blade in the trigger guard of a weapon that has one 
(pistol, revolver, hand crossbow). If this blocks the attack, you each may 
attempt to wrestle the entangled weapons free from the other by making your 
choice of an athletics or acrobatics check. Whoever succeeds retains their
weapon and knocks their opponent's weapon onto the ground.

### Bayonet
On a two-handed crossbow or firearm, you may now install a shortsword as a
bayonet. When wielding a weapon equipped with a bayonet, you are able to defend
against approaching enemies. When a creature that you can see enters a range of
10 feet of you, you may use your reaction to make an melee attack at them.
This attack uses your strength modifier and deals 1d8 piercing damage on a
hit.

### Army Crawl
Your ranged attacks no longer suffer disadvantage from being prone, and while
prone you may now take the dash action to move your normal speed.

### Corner Shot
If you are behind full cover, you may peek out one side in order to make a
single attack against an enemy. This will trigger held actions to attack you
with ranged weapons, but you will still have half cover from these attacks.
Using this ability does not require movement.

### Double Tap
After hitting an enemy with a ranged attack using a weapon that still has
more ammunition, you may use your reaction to fire an additional time. You
cannot use double-tap if you have fired more than once already on this turn.

### Action Surge
You may now expend a stamina die take one additional action this turn. You may
only use action surge once per turn.

### Properties

#### Reloading Property
A weapon with the reloading property contains one or more pieces of ammunition.
You may expend an action to reload such a weapon up to its full capacity,
provided you have enough ammunition to do so.

#### Burst Fire
Instead of a normal ranged weapon attack, a weapon with the burst fire property
may fire ten rounds of ammunition in rapid succession on a ten foot cube. Every
creature inside the cube must succeed a DC15 dex saving throw or receive the
weapon’s normal damage. This consumes ten rounds of ammunition. If the creature
is beyond the weapon's normal crange, the save is made with advantage. If
the creature is within half the weapon's normal range, the creature is hit with
twice the weapon's normal damage dice.

### Bomb
You may use your action to light and throw a bomb at a point within 30 feet. It
explodes upon impact. All creatures within 15 feet of the bomb must make a DC15
dex saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failure and half as much on a
success.

### Dynamite
You may use your action to throw a stick of dynamite at a point within 30 feet.
It explodes on impact. All creatures within 15 feet of the bomb must make a DC15
dex saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failure and half as much on a
success.

You can attach up to 3 sticks of dynamite together. Each stick increases the
damage dealt by 3d

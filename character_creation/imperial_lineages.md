# Imperial Lineages

The fall of the dwarven empires brought trade to a screeching halt and forced

became the foundation of the meteoric rise of the human empires. With them,
a wave of colonization that rippled through every land that could be reliably
reached by ship or trade caravan. Roll a 1d10 for a random lineage.

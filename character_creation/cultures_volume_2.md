# Age of Magic
```
Gone are the gods of old.
Their blood seeps into the grounds and across the planes.
Their rivers of golden ichor change all in their wake.
The Styx, The Heavens, The Hells, Faeland, and The Abyss all made from the 
corpses of the almighty.
Oh the misery.
Oh the grace.
How great a thing.
How horrible a sorrow.
What a tradgedy.
What an honor.
- Fae Creationist Poem

From the primordial ooze left behind by the dead bodies of ancient gods, the
planes as they are known emerged, and with them, the first mortal cultures. 
These cultures were largely magical in nature due to corruptions or innate magic
aquired from the ichor left behind by the gods. The age of magic was an arcane
arms race between ten distinct cultures all vying to continue existing and 
expand their influence. Different cultures flocked to and emerged from
different planes, causing extreme differences in belief systems.

## 1 Abyssal
Gaining their name and likeness from the cold abyss, members of the abyssal 
culture have been shaped by the indifferent abyss into beings of massive
strength and fortitude. The abyssal culture is militaristic and one of conquest.
Some members of the abyssal culture use various means to corrupt their body,
prioritizing strength over their own well being.

### Abyssal Rite
As a coming of age ritual in the abyssal culture you undergo a transformative 
rite, transforming your body and giving you immunity to poison damage and 
resistance to necrotic and cold damage. This rite does come at a cost, however. 
A creature may utter your true name as an action, giving you disadvantage on 
attack rolls and ability checks against them until their next turn. If a 
creature utters your true name to you three times without any break 
(1 or more turn) between the the actions you must succeed a DC 15 wisdom saving 
throw or be stunned until an ally utters your name three times in the same 
manner. The distinction between these two usages is largely based on intention 
and context.

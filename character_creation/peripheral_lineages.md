# Peripheral Lineages
In the shadow of the human empire, and outside it's consideration live a great
variety of peoples. While such people may find themselves interacting with
or among empirial zones of influence, they are a rare occurence. 

## Turned
You were a mAge: who suffered a manageable disaster. Through a misfiring of
a spell, your form has been permanently altered beyond recognition of what
it once was.

### Risidual magic
You know the Minor Illusion cantrip found in the spell compendium volume 1, and
may cast it by expending one hit die.

### Form
You may choose one of the three most common afflictions below.

#### Cat (Tiny, +2 DEX, +1 CHA)
You resemble a large black cat with a white spot on your chest. Your thumbless
paws are clumsy and you may not wield two-handed weapons. You require both paws
to wield one-handed weapons. You may either stand upright at a height of nearly
four feet on your digitigrade legs or on all fours and become indistinguishable
from a large house cat. Your size is small.

##### Claws (requires at least 15 dexterity)
You've learned to make quick swipes with your claws to deal damAge: to soft
spots. Your unarmed attacks are made with dexterity as the ability, and deal
1d4 slashing damage.

#### Squid (Medium, +2 INT, +1 DEX)
Your skin is clammy and rubbery to the touch, and it changes color according to
your emotion. Your smooth head is bulbous, and from your mouth extends a beard
of writhing tentacles that may pull in morsels or hold them still. Your body
lacks bones, and you have no brain. Your hands terminate in five tendrils, and
your feet are long tentacles dropping from your sleek torso. You have a swim
speed of 30 feet.

##### Camoflauge (requires at least 15 wisdom)
While unclothed, you may make a DC 15 wisdom check to cause your skin to match
the coloration of the surrounding terrain and for your body's texture to change
as well in mimicry. A creature that has not witnessed you perform this change
must succeed a DC 18 perception check to detect your presence visually.

#### Moth (Medium +2 WIS, +1 INT)
You are covered in tufts of white hair, and on your back a set of wings. Your
bulbous black eyes are vulnerable to bright light, and you have disadvantAge: on
attacks and perception checks relying on sight made in direct sunlight. You have
a flying speed of 30 feet.

##### Electrosight (requires at least 15 wisdom)
The fuzzy antennae that jut from the top of your head can detect minute
electrical currents. For the purpose of sensing creatures, you have blindsight
for 10 feet.

## Hobgoblins [WIP]

```
Age: less than a century
Languages: Goblin, one other
Size: Medium
Speed: 30
Ability Score Increase: +2 STR, +1 INT

### House
Hobgoblin culture tends to reject the worship of deities in favor of strict
adherence to the teachings of long-dead Hobgoblin philosophers.

#### Zarrat
Power drives the house of Zarrat, whose youths undergo a series of bloody trials
in order to reach adulthood and be assigned position of leader, warrior, or
peasant. Those deemed weak are outcast from Zarrat society, and what issues
cannot be decided by consensus among leaders is instead solved by public duels.

#### Lurdek
Everything has it's price, and those within the house of Lurdek are constantly
looking for it. The most successful followers of Lurdek leverage trade to meet
all of their needs, never toiling to produce any resources themselves. Beneath
them is a fleet of traveling traders, and beneath them peasants grinding to
secure their own business opportunities.

#### Marr
People is the house of Marr's singular focus.
Community drives the house of Marr, who call votes for large decision and share 
what resources they have with house members and also outsiders. Not only do
followers of Marr refuse to turn away those in need, but they often seek out
the liberation of anyone occupying the bottom rungs of society.

## Spadetails
The rise and fall of empires has been of little concern to those who carry 
infernal blood in their veins. What matters to them has always been the 
ubiquitous superstition and persecution that pervades all but a handful of 
sympathetic or ambivalent communities. Lacking homeland to defend or retreat 
to, the infernally infused seek shelter with those fringe elements that will 
have them, or else attempt to conceal their true identity when possible.

### Infernal Cosmetics
Some are born knowing they are infernal, and for others the signs come later
in life. Select 1d4 traits below, if you wish. For each, roll a 1d6 and reroll
on duplicates.
- Red, leathery skin
- Black irises
- Spaded tail
- Forked tongue
- Sharp teeth
- Small horns

### Winged Flight (requires at least 15 STR)
You have functioning wings. You have a flying speed of 50 feet.

### Infernal Hide (requires at least 15 CON)
Your skin is not only leathery and red, but protective. You have resistance to
fire damage.

### Uncharmed (requires at least 15 INT)
Your mind can detect the patterns of incoming charms as readily as it can
identify words. You cannot be charmed.

### Devil's Sight (requires at least 17 WIS)
Your eyes glow red or golden in the night, and you may see 120 feet in pitch
black as if it were bright light.

### Hellish Rebuke (requires at least 17 CHA)
As a reaction when you receive damAge: from an attack, you may expend a hit die
and call out a short phrase of infernal to the attacker. That creature must
make a dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 fire damAge: on a failure or half as
much on a success when your words burn them.

## Forged
You were a noble knight before a soul forger saw to it that you would outlive
your last breath. Charged with the protection of a powerful noble, you find that
mortal lifespans seem short now. You were robbed of the simple pleasures mortals
take for granted: smell, taste, and touch.

```

### Reconstruction
Every time you restore hit points from expending a hit die or finishing a partial
or long rest, you must consume 1 unit of scrap. (See soul forger class) Your
body will ingest the metals, rebuilding itself and excreting metal slag from
your metal skin. If the mending spell is cast on you, you restore 1d8 hit
points.

### Construct
You do not need to breathe, eat, drink water, nor sleep. Exceedingly hot
and cold weather have no effect on you.

### Steel Hull (requires at least 15 CON)
Your form is protected by an exterior of high carbon steel. Your AC may not
fall below 15.

### Fireproof Hull (requires at least 17 CON)
Though you may glow red hot under flame, your form endures. You are resistant to
fire damage.

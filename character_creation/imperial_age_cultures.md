# Imperial Age Cultures
```
Gone is the age of titans.
Felled are the great brutes which feasted on bone of man and god.
Brave founders repelled them!
To the snowy mountains!
To the black ocean!
To the bowels of the Earth!
Farewell, titans.
The world will rise once more
standing hand in hand
in the glory of the empire!
- Anthem of the Empire of Man

The empire of man expanded one city at a time, propelled by the many peoples'
revulsion toward their titan overlords, consuming the world. It's collapse was
as inevitable as it's rise. Once the last overlord fell, the empire boiled over
in a war of self-determination for many of it's constituent states. When the dust
settled, only a shriveled core of the empire remained and the remainder of the
world exploded in unrestricted vitality and growth in spite of the great
network of imperial trade routes vanishing overnight.
```

## 1 Imperial
Those who benefited most from the imperial core's wealth and abundance of
imports long for the return of the empire. Time is an arrow pointing forward for
imperial society, and the fall set time back a hundred years in their eyes. The
prevailing social theory is one of distinct hierarchy, where the enlightened and
well-educated elite make decisions on behalf of the less civilized masses.

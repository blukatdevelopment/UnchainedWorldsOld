# Keeper's Guide
The player's handbook is incredibly terse and intended to provoke rulings, rather than rules discussion.
This guide will provide the keeper with the rationale and suggested rulings that I, Blukat, have used when designing these rules.
The content of this guide aren't rules you are bound to, nor are they a contract you have made with your players.
Instead, these are intended to help if you aren't sure where to start with making your own rulings.

# Gear
The weapons and armor tables in the player handbook are skeletal to keep character creation basic. If that's what you want, ignore the rest of this section. If you want players to discover a greater variety of weapons in the world, use these rules.

## Gear properties
These are tags that modify a weapon or armor's stats and effect trade value. These can stack with weapon and armor variants.

### Wood/Bone/Stone/Worn/Rusty
Break when giving/receiving max damage. Little to no trade value. Arm monsters who can't afford regular weapons with these.

### Inferior/Shabby/Flawwed/Inferior/Cracked/Dull/Bent
Provides one less AC, or otherwise one less damage(minimum 1). Apply to discount gear, or apply to wielded gear during a critical failure instead of outright destroying the item.

### Fine/Superior/Hardened/Reinforced
Armor has a +1 AC, weapon has +1 to damage. On a critical failure, just take away this tag. Give the cost a 25-100% increase and describe the fine crafstmanship.

# Combat

## Critical hits
When a combatant rolls a 20 on a D20, it's a crit. In addition to whatever damage bonus they do, you may elevate the intensity by introducing some side-effect. Perhaps the combatant disarms an enemy.

## Critical failures
When a combatant rolls a 1 on a D20, it's a fumble. In addition to missing, a negative side-effect can highten this moment. This may involve their weapon breaking, being thrown, or knocked out of their hand. A bow snapping may cause D4 damage. A broken claymore can be treated as a sword, and a broken sword can act as a dagger.

## Enemy damage
Players can't see the enemy's HP. Even if you show it to them, watching a bar deplete is boring. Convey the damage in these ways to change the dynamic of the combat as damage is dealt.

### Degrading ability
When a PC deals a high damage attack, consider one of these:
- Armor/shell is destroyed, lowering AC
- Targetable weakpoint is created, which takes bonus damage(max die, extra die)
- Weapon breaks, reducing their damage output(and loot)
- Loss of limb, -6 penalty to any roll using that limb

### Morale
Humanoids, and even monsters may not be interested in fighting to the death. Predatory beasts, in general, are looking for easy prey and won't want to risk a serious altercation. Humanoids are reminded of their own mortality when they see their comrades die, and may flee or surrender if they sense they are in a death spiral. This gives space for mindless or exceptionally brave monsters to stand out as particularly dangerous. It also ends fights early, potentially creating fun moments where fleeing bandits create a reputation that preceeds the party, or where a freed cultist becomes a contact for the party.

For morale checks, a DC 15 WIS check should work.

### Boss stages
Steal from videogames for enemies with a large amount of HP. Each third of the health is a different stage. You may change the abilities or attacks used, but also the behavior.

For instance, a confident boss may lead with tactically unsound or weak attacks as it under-estimates the party in stage 1. In stage 2, it may apply more powerful abilities and select more tactically sound options. In stage 3, the creature is panicking and using every possible resource at its disposal.

# Arcane Magic
This is the most straight-forward type of vancian magic. Unless the Arcana skill(See: Skills) is used to alter the spell, it's played based on the description using best judgement for interpretation.

## Creating spells
Here's some guidelines:
- One sentence, or \~50 word description
- 3d6 damage is a good benchmark for damage. Scale up or down according to things like range, area of effect, etc.
- Use 5ft increments for ranges
- Durations should look like 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, until cast again, etc

### Damage
- Arcane spells are costly(in HP) to spam, so higher damage values can be used without making them an instant win button
- 3d6 (average 12) is the equivalent of landing three martial weapon attacks
- 8d6 (average 40) is enough to kill even the strongest humanoids reliably

### Saving throws
There are a few types of saves related to a spell:
- Save to avoid effect
- Save to halve damage
- Save on end/start of each turn to end effect

### Durations
There are a few types of duration that can be useful:
- 1 minute (very powerful effects)
- 10 minutes (powerful effects)
- 1 hour (stronger stat buffs)
- 1 day (long-lasting effects such as stat buffs)
- Until cast again(for semi-permanent spells where only one effect should be active at once. These become permanent if the caster dies.)
- until dismissed(for semi-permanent spells that may stack over multiple days. Require a material component to be consumed for these to make them less spammable. These become permanent if the caster dies.)
- permanent(default for effects like one-time damage or healing)

97. Truth: You touch a creature, and for the next hour it can only speak the truth to the best of its ability.
98. Resurrection: You destroy a soul gem and sprinkle the dust over a corpse, bringing it back to life.
99. Life drain: A creature you can see must succeed a WIS save to halve 10 damage and avoid transfering 10 years of youth to you.
100. Aura of life: Now, and at the start of your turn for the next minute, you may heal all creatures within 10ft of you for 1d4 hit points.

# Divine Magic

## Creating spells
Given a two word description and a DC, create a spell as if making an arcane spell. Except, adjust for the spell's DC.
### Cantrip (DC 5)
To make these spells feel unique, require only one action to cast. This makes them extremely spammable. Make them deal no more than D6 damage, and require either a successful spell attack, or a saving throw in order to deal any damage. If they give a buff, it lasts for one round. If they heal, make the duration 10 minutes, come with a material cost, or require the target to have no less than half their HP. Capping healing at 1 or 2 HP may be wise, as it will be spammed whenever possible.

### Minor (DC 8)
With a +8, these spells are still incredibly spammable, but once once per turn in combat. A D12 is the max damage you'll want to deal. For healing, follow the guidelines of the cantrip, but increase the HP amount to D4.

### Average (DC 10)
These are less spammable than a minor spell, particularly for weaker mages. 3d4 or 2d6 damage is appropriate, with saves to halve that damage allowing automatic damage to enemies. You may allow a 10ft radius, 15ft cone or a 20ft cube for crowd control spells. Buffs effecting multiple targets for a minute or so are also good here. Healing D6 or D8 over the course of 10 minutes, or instantly healing D4 HP is reasonable.

### Major (DC 12)
These are harder-hitting spells that require more skill to consistently pull off. 4d4 or 3d6 damage is appropriate, with saves to halve that damage. You may want to add side-effects or conditions to failed saves, further bolstering their power. Flat-out healing D6 or D8 is reasonable, or a flat amount like 5HP.

### Superior (DC 15)
To make these spells feel unique, require three actions to cast. This makes them feel more like game-changers. This is where powerful buffs and high damage spells shine. Single-target spells might deal 6d6 damage, while area of effect spells might deal 4d6 and give saves to halve that damage. Healing 2d6 or a flat amount like 10HP.

# Skills
The skills perk is a tool to create implicit, dynamic sub-systems. Provided in this section are recommendations for mechanics for those sub-systems. Ideally, the keeper tracks these details and the players interact with them through the fiction of the world. If you use these recommended sub-systems, you may share them with inquiring players when they get the skill perk.

## Difficulty class for skill checks
Regardless of sub-system, the PC will attempt actions and you will provide a DC for them to roll against when it's unclear what the outcome is. To account for different levels of skill proficiency(the size of the skill die) and the size of the modifier(primarily focused on 0 to +5 here), you can 

### Trivial(DC 5)
- Everyone is likely to succeed
- A high mod without any skill guarantees success

### Easy(DC 10)
- With no ability or skill, it's a 50-50 chance
- Able and skilled PCs have a very safe bet of success

### Average(DC 15)
- Unlikely without great skill or ability
- Only the most able and skilled PCs can trivialize this DC

### Adept(DC 20)
- Nearly impossible without skill or ability
- A high-risk proposition for the able and skilled

### Advanced(DC 25)
- Impossible by ability alone
- Becomes viable only with high degree of skill and ability
- Suitable for crafting or brewing potent items

### Expert(DC 30)
- Mind-blowing feats impossible to all but experts
- Suitable for repeatable tasks, such as crafting or brewing very powerful items

### Legendary(DC 35)
- Only a fool would gamble their life on this
- Suitable for repeatable tasks that take are expensive of lengthy, such as crafting or brewing legendary items

## Sub-systems
These are recommendations for how to handle these different sub-systems. If you are a player reading this section, know that there's no obligation for the keeper to follow these recommendations. Players should interact with the world through the world's fiction, placing the autonomy over adjudication squarely on the keeper.

### Pickpocketing
Start with a DC of 25 and subtract 5 from the DC for each of these:
- No particular item in mind
- Target is in crowded area
- Target expects normal physical contact
- Item is hanging by a strap that can be cut
Add 5 to the DC for each of these:
- Item is large(like a sword or bow)
- Item is heavy(like a greataxe or sack of grain)

If the PC fails to pick-pocket by only a bit(around 5), make them succeed in stealing the item, but fail to do so undetected. If they fail by a large amount, either have the target immediately identify them as a thief, or otherwise stop the theft from occurring altogether.


### Lockpicking
Start with a DC of 25 and subtract 5 from the DC for each of these:
- Lockpicking tool is purpose-made and not improvised
- No one is within earshot
- No one has line of sight with the PC
Add 5 to the DC for any of these
- Lock is reinforced or particularly secure

If the PC fails by a bit(around 5), make them succeed in unlocking the door while potentially alerting. If they fail by a bit more(around 10), the lock requires more time, and they have potentially alerted someone. This creates a scenario where NPCs must be pacified while the PC finishes lockpicking, or otherwise the PC opens the door to find NPCs who are prepared for them.

### Acrobatics
Here's some examples of tasks fitting under each difficulty
- Trivial: Crossing a plank bridge, standing on one foot
- Easy: Climbing onto a moving wagon, a 5ft horizontal jump
- Average: a 10ft horizontal jump, sticking a 10ft landing, jumping off a moving wagon
- Adept: a 15ft horizontal jump, sticking a 15ft landing, walking a tight-rope, moving through an enemy's space
- Advanced: a 20ft horizontal jump, sticking a 20ft landing, running on a tight-rope, safely making an attack or grapple while falling
- Expert: a 25ft horizontal jump, sticking a 25ft landing, wall-running
- Legendary: a 30ft horizontal jump, 5ft vertical jump, sticking a 30ft landing

### Athletics
Here's some examples of tasks under each difficulty
- Trivial: Catching or throwing a ball 30ft
- Easy: Vaulting over a fence or pole-vaulting over a gap
- Average: Kicking down a door, tripping a humanoid, dragging very heavy object
- Adept: Rock-climbing without tools, Climbing on a giant creature
- Advanced: Throwing a grappled humanoid 10ft
- Expert: Throwing a grappled humanoid 15ft
- Legendary: Knocking a larger creature prone
If contested, let the DC be a STR check from the opponent.

### Arcana
When recalling lore, base the difficulty on how common or accessible the knowledge is:
- Trivial: Exists in nursery rhymes or cautionary tales
- Easy: Subject of widely-circulated rumors or myths
- Average: Mentioned frequrntly in guide books
- Adept: Available in most encyclopedias and larger volumes
- Advanced: Available in select texts circulated among specialists
- Expert: Knowledge found only from lost documents or isolated witnesses
- Legendary: Knowledge that is actively guarded
For sensing magical presence, start with a DC of 15 and adjust it in increments of 5 depending on whether it's near or far, strong or weak.
For reading spells, DC 20 should suffice.

### Crafting
Here are some common tasks with difficulties
- Trivial: Making a sturdy staff, spear, club, great club from wood(break on first use if failed)
- Easy: Replace a broken handle, reattach a tool/weapon head
- Average: Create a batch of arrows from materials, adhere or sew items
- Adept: Welding two metal items together
- Advanced: Smith a weapon or tool, combine magical elements of two magic items, reforging a broken blade
- Expert: Smith armor, combine more than a total of two magic items into one
- Legendary: 
If someone fails to repair or create an item by a great amount, they don't notice they failed until they use it for the first time and it breaks. Smithing and creating items can be attempted many times, with a D6 chance of losing some amount of materials on a failure.

### Alchemy

#### Creating tinctures
Each alchemical ingredient can be brewed into a tincture with a single property. Yield is determined by size of ingredient. You may brew with batches of small or tiny items, or using flasks, provided none of the ratios change.
| Size  | # of vials |
|:------|:-----------|
| Large |         16 |
| Small |          4 |
| Tiny  |          1 |
Brewing a tincture is an **easy** task. If failed, the ingredient is lost.


#### Creating potions
A flask of potion can be made from 4 tinctures(or two flasks), combined in different ways to achieve different results. If this is failed, the tinctures are lost in the process.

##### (Trivial) Simple
Combine 4 tinctures from the same ingredient, giving the same property.

##### (Average) Synthesize
Combine 2 tinctures from one ingredient, two tinctures from another. Each ingredient must have a different property. The resulting potion has a new property combining the two.

##### (Adept) Prolong
Combine 4 tinctures with the same property, but each from a different ingredient. The resulting potion's property has a weaker than normal effect. If the property has a duration, it is increased.

##### (Adept) Enhance
Combine 4 tinctures with the same property, but each from a different ingredient. The resulting potion has a stronger than normal effect. If there is a duration for the property, it is reduced.

##### (Advanced) Substitute
Combine 3 identical tinctures with one different tincture. The potion takes the effect of the different tincture, as if combining 4 of that tincture normally.

##### (Advanced) Compound
Combine 2 tinctures from one ingredient, two tinctures from another. Each ingredient must have a different property. The resulting potion has both properties.

### Medicine
Creating a medicinal product requires ten minutes and one an ingredient such as a medicinal herb, mushroom, or monster part. Failing to create a medicine destroys the ingredient used in the attempt.

- (Average)Ointment: Heals D4 HP, provided target has half or more of their max HP. Expires after one day.
- (Adept)Purifying salve: Removes one poison-related condition, masks an active illness's symptoms
- (Adept)Healer's kit: Same as in player handbook
- (Adept)Smelling Salt: resussicates a fallen creature back to 1HP, provided they aren't beyond saving
- (Advanced)Advanced healer's kit: Same as in player's handbook, except it heals 2d6 HP

### Sneaking
When sneaking around a single NPC, require a contested check of DEX vs WIS of that NPC.
If there's a group of NPCs, pick one NPC with the highest WIS.
If there's a huge crowd, such as in a city, give a -3 penalty to the NPC making the check.
A slight failure(less than 5) might mean an NPC hears something or catches something out of the corner of their eye.
A more intense failure(5 or more) might mean an NPC recognizes the PC's voice or appearance, their bearing, and their current location.

### Tracking

#### Identify signs of nearby creatures
Ask for a roll and see what they get
- DC 10: Find obvious tracks
- DC 13: Age of tracks, number of creatures
- DC 15: Fur, hair, feathers, fabric

#### Bait and repellant 
DC 15 tracking check to know what ingredients to use in either case.

### Persuasion
DC 15 for most negotiations, and DC 20 when dealing with hostiles. Reduce the DC by 5(or auto-succeed) if there's a bribe or a concrete appeal made by the player via roleplay.

### Deception
Contested deception check against target's WIS check.

### Intimidation
Contested intimidation check against target's WIS check. If the target has a reason to already be scared, give it a -3 or -6 penalty.

### Performance
Soothing the emotions of an angry creature may be DC 15 or DC 20, but easier tasks such as entertaining commoners may be DC 10. Those with refined tastes may require a DC 15 to be satisfied.

### Insight
Contested check against target's deception check, but inform the party that you'll roll regardless of whether there's an attempt at deception. DC 15 to get more information from the target if insight isn't being used as a lie detector.

### Foraging
Foraging as an activity should take about a third of a day, roughly 3 hours. Each item found is Tiny and spoils after one day.

#### Finding alchemical ingredients
Finding alchemical ingredients means finding many different plants, mushrooms, etc, and then testing them for alchemical properties. The yield is typically very small and unreliable due to the chaotic nature of alchemy in nature.

Make a foraging check against the table below:
| Roll | Types found |
|:-----|:------------|
| < 15 |           0 |
| 15   |           1 |
| 20   |          D2 |
| 25+  |          D4 |
For each type found, roll a prompt for its effect using 3d12 on the table below. The forager finds D4 of each type.

| D6 | Object   | Property 1| Property 2 |
|:---|:---------|:----------|:-----------|
| 1  | Mushroom | Acid      | Spray      |
| 2  | Root     | Ice       | Shards     |
| 3  | Leaf     | Fire      | Breath     |
| 4  | Flower   | Lightning | Project    |
| 5  | Fruit    | Poison    | Cloud      |
| 6  | Seed     | Shadow    | Aura       |
| 7  | Bark     | Mind      | Enhance    |
| 8  | Sap      | Size      | Weaken     |
| 9  | Vine     | Shape     | Transform  |
| 10 | Stem     | Vision    | Resist     |
| 11 | Nut      | Emotion   | Inflict    |
| 12 | Moss     | Gravity   | Conjure    |

For example, rolling 11, 10, and 1 gives a prompt of Nut, Vision, Spray. Given this prompt, this may be a nut with an effect of producing a blinding spray when consumed.


#### Finding medicinal ingredients
Make a foraging check against the below table to see how many pieces are recovered.

| Roll | Ingredients |
|:-----|:------------|
| < 10 |           0 |
| 10   |          D6 |
| 15   |         2d6 |
| 20   |         3d4 |
| 25   |         3d6 |

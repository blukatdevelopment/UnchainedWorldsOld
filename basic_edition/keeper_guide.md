# Keeper info
## Running monsters

### Looting Monsters
#### Weapons and Armor
Roll a d6. On a 6, the item is intact. On a 4-5 the item is damaged and suffers a penalty(-1 for 5, -2 for 4) for AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls until repaired. On a 1-3, the item is scrap. In some situations, 6 scrap of the same item may be combined to craft one intact item. This may require tools and DEX or INT checks to succeed.

#### Parts
If it's ambiguous, roll 4 or higher on a D6 to determine that a part(eyes, fangs, heart, etc) is intact and harvestable. Call for a DEX and INT check if surgical precision is needed to remove an internal organ intact, usually DC 11 or 12.

#### Gold
If it's ambiguous what value of loot is on a creature, roll the creature's hit dice to determine a worth in either copper, silver, or gold pieces. Humanoids may have loose change and trinkets on them, while monsters will generally have valuable parts.

## Creating Monsters
To run this game, a keeper keeps track of a roster of monsters they may bring out. They can either prepare monster stat blocks ahead of time, or generate them. The keeper's guide will focus on monster creation. For a list of premade monsters, please see the monster guide.

### Stat block explanation
`Commoner, HD: 1d4, AC:10, Club 1d4`
Each stat block is broken into multiple parts.

#### Hit dice(HD)
You roll the dice specified to determine HP. Alternatively, you may take the average or maximum value.
The number of dice determines the monster's base attack modifier.

#### Armor and Armor Class (AC)
This works just like armor class for player characters. 10+DEX+ARMOR is the formula you'll generally go for when coming up with an AC for a monster. High AC causes frequent misses, which you can describe as blows glancing off of armor or being expertly dodged. You may specify any armor in parentheses.

### Attacks
A name and damage dice are provided. Unless specified, the attack modifier is the number of hit dice. A 1d4 monster has +1 to hit, 2d4 has +2, etc.

### Stat block base
If you'd like to make your own stat blocks, here's some partially made stat blocks you can adapt.

`Wimp, HD: 1d4, AC: 10, Club 1d4`
`Adept, HD: 5d4, AC: 12, Dagger 1d4`
`Expert, HD: 10d4, AC: 12, Staff 1d6`
`Mook, HD: 3d6, AC: 11, Sword 1d6`
`Bruiser, HD: 3d10, AC: 14(chainmail), sword 1d6`
`Tank, HD: 3d20, AC: 11(natural), Greatsword 1d12`
`Boss Monster, HD: 5d20, AC: 12(natural), Bite 1d12`
`Legendary Monster, HD: 10d20, AC: 15(natural), Bite 1d12`

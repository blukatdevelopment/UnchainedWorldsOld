### Lore
Bandits live on the outskirts of civilization, using the monster-ridden wilds and ruins therein to protect against scouts and search parties. Bandits attack travelers, generally charging little or nothing from the peasantry. Bandit hideouts often serve as a hub for black market commerce and a safe haven for criminals and persecuted individuals alike.

### Variations
Roll for a type of bandit group. You may roll multiple and decide whether they ignore one another, compete for a market or resource, or otherwise cooperate.
1. Street Gang
2. Crime Haven
3. Suppliers
4. Highwaymen
5. Warlord
6. Rebels

#### Street Gang
Street gangs oversee racketeering, robberies, dealing black market items. With active resistance from the law, they are likely to rely on easily concealed or improvized weapons such as daggers, clubs, and hand crossbows, and are less likely to wear armor or uniforms. Street gangs who have competition tend to wear common colors to 
Roll 3d6 for table below to create a street gang.

| D6 | Racket     | Black Market | Defense         |
|:---|:-----------|:-------------|:----------------|
|  1 | Salt       | Moon Dust    | Powerful leader |

|  5 | Protection | Assassins    | Terror          |
|  6 | Laundering | Fences       | Infiltration    |

#### Crime Haven
Den of smugglers, crime bosses, asylum-seekers, and opportunists. Havens generally act to connect one or more other groups of bandits. Bandits in crime havens are extremely likely to employ ostentatious and illegal weapons or armor in plain sight without fear of legal recourse. Those not affiliated with the owner are sometimes disarmed at the door when doing business to prevent bloodshed over disagreements.
Roll 3d6 for table below to create a crime haven.

| D6 | Owner              | Workers            | Building
|:---|:-------------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
|  1 | Crime boss         | Thugs              | Keep           |
|  2 | Corrupt Merchant   | Street urchins     | Walled village |
|  3 | Cult leader        | Religious refugees | Temple         |
|  4 | Mercenaries        | Escaped convicts   | Camp           |
|  5 | Monster            | Adventurers        | Cave network   |
|  6 | Bounty Hunters     | Corrupted          | Island         |

#### Suppliers
Suppliers grow, manufacture, or collect black market goods.
Roll 3d6 for table below to create a group of suppliers.

| D6 | Good           | Defense     | Workers   |
|:---|:---------------|:------------|:----------|
|  1 | Moon Dust      | Monsters    | Peasants  |
|  2 | Moon Grass     | Traps       | Thugs     |
|  3 | Weapons        | Remote      | Monsters  |
|  4 | Organs         | Cultists    | Corrupted |
|  5 | Counterfeits   | Disguise    | Cultists  |
|  6 | Mercenaries    | Mercenaries | Orphans   |

#### Highwaymen
Highwaymen rob caravans, impose fees and tolls on travelers. More often than not, these groups are criminal in nature, but occassionally they may get permission from a kingdom by offering a cut of their earnings. Sometimes these groups are sent directly by kingdoms.
Roll 3d4 for table below to create a group of highwaymen.

| D6 | Leader     | Workers        | Strength  |
|:---|:-----------|:---------------|:----------|
|  1 | Monster    | Corrupt guards | Numbers   |
|  2 | General    | Veterans       | Training  |
|  3 | Peasant    | Peasants       | Magic     |
|  4 | Crime boss | Corrupted      | Gear      |

#### Warlord
Warlords raise an army to collect taxes and tribute as well as to pillage. Warlords can have ambitions of rivaling nearby kingdoms or merely sustaining a life of luxury and power for the leader. Roll 2d4 for the table below.

| D4 | Leader              | Army              |
|:---|:--------------------|:------------------|
|  1 | Monster             | Monsters          |
|  2 | Defected General    | Defected soldiers |
|  3 | Crime Boss          | Thugs             |
|  4 | Merchant            | Mercenaries       |

#### Rebels
Rebel groups generally organize to resist the current rulers for a cause that is deemed just. Charismatic leaders centralize the power of such efforts, making it easier to disband or pacify their groups through coercion, bribery, or elimination of said leader. Groups with unremarkable or anonymous leaders are far more difficult to dissuade.
Roll 2d6 for the columns of the table below.

| D6 | Leader           | Agenda        |
|:---|:-----------------|:--------------|
|  1 | Religious Figure | Meet demands  |
|  2 | Commoner         | Depose rulers |
|  3 | Idealogue        | Revolution    |
|  4 | General          | Become Leader |
|  5 | Anonymous Figure | Revenge       |
|  6 | Merchant         | Corner Market |

## Humanoids

### Stat Block
```
Commoner, HP: 10, AC: 10 [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
Unarmed +0 D2
Club +0 D4
Loot: 3d20 CP
```

### Lore
The blood of civilization that make footholds in the furthest reaches of the world.

### Variations
Humanoids may be created with exactly the same rules as player characters.
However, here are some common archetypes.


## Authorities
Stable humanoid settlements gather around some set of norms. When you violate these norms sufficiently, or attempt to change them, you learn who holds authority.

Roll once to make a simple settlement, twice to make one with tension and conflict, and three or more times to create an environment conducive to political intrigue.
1. Royals
2. Nobles
3. Commoners
4. Merchants
5. Sages
6. Reroll

### Royals
Royals are a miniscule minority which are famously offered few checks or balances. The difference between royals and warlords is primarily in technique. While a warlord must fight an ongoing war with their tributaries to keep them beaten into submission, royals rely on a myth to do that for them. For a simpler group of royals, roll a D3 (or D4, discounting 4s) for their myth, or roll twice(rerolling on a duplicate) for royals with a main and secondary myth.

1. Birthright
2. Popularity
3. Terror

#### Birthright
A royal bloodline is the legacy of more aggressive power brokers. The most mundane birthright is reinforced by other authorities for its own sake. More exotic birthright might be tied to an ancestry including eldritch, fey, dragon, or demon blood in addition to humanoid. Lastly, divine birthright may come from a powerful supernatural entity's favor of the royals, or at least of the myth of such favor.

#### Popularity
Royals sell themselves, or the process that grants them power, as benevolent. A people's king may give gifts or share the spoils of war with the peasantry. An election may take place between multiple royals, all sharing similar vested interest in preserving the same status quo.

#### Terror
Royals instill fear in their subjects, either of the royals themselves, or some real or imaginary enemy. When the people believe their survival depends upon the royals, they are more likely to cooperate and compromise on their ideals. When the royals become the subject of fear, they aim for creating an image of resistance being hopeless and futile. The exchange of information is generally tightly controlled, and there is an ongoing task of finding and crushing cells of resistance.

### Nobles
Nobles are often granted a lesser power by Commoners or Royals only to later overpower them. You may roll for one type of noble.

1. Merchants
2. Mages
3. Diviners
4. Philosophers

#### Merchants
The wealth of successful merchants allows them to seize the most lucrative business opportunities, compounding their wealth over time as they minimize competition and maximize profit. The conversion of wealth into power through bribery is what allows merchants to gain power without getting their hands dirty.

#### Warriors

#### Mages

#### Diviners

#### Philosophers

### Commoners

### Lore
Bandits live on the outskirts of civilization, using the monster-ridden wilds and ruins therein to protect against scouts and search parties. Bandits attack travelers, generally charging little or nothing from the peasantry. Bandit hideouts often serve as a hub for black market commerce and a safe haven for criminals and persecuted individuals alike.

### Variations
Roll for a type of bandit group. You may roll multiple and decide whether they ignore one another, compete for a market or resource, or otherwise cooperate.

2. Crime Haven
3. Suppliers
4. Highwaymen
5. Warlord
6. Rebels

#### Street Gang
Oversee racketeering, robberies, dealing black market items. Street gangs with active resistance from the law are likely to rely on easily concealed or improvized weapons such as daggers, clubs, and hand crossbows, and are less likely to wear armor or uniforms. Street gangs who have competition tend to wear common colors to

#### Crime Haven
Den of smugglers, crime bosses, asylum-seekers, and opportunists. Havens generally act to connect one or more other groups of bandits. Bandits in crime havens are extremely likely to employ ostentatious and illegal weapons or armor in plain sight without fear of legal recourse. Those not affiliated with the owner are sometimes disarmed at the door when doing business to prevent bloodshed over disagreements.

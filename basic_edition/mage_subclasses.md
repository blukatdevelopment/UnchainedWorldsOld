# Mage subclasses
This book contains variants of the mage defined in the player handbook. Refer
to the rules for the mage class, applying changes described here to it for any
given subclass.

## Ritualist:
You may only prepare one spell of your choice at a time from the mage spell
list, provided you meet the level requirement. You may spend 50GP and 1 day
studying a spell from a scroll or book in order to convert it into a ritual.
This erases it frm the spell scroll or book you got it from. Spell preparation
time can be found below.

```
+-------------+------------------+
| Spell Level | Preparation time |
+-------------+------------------+
| 1           | 10 minutes       |
| 3           | 1 hour           |
| 5           | 8 hours          |
| non-mage    | 1 hour           |
+-------------+------------------+
```

## Alchemist:
You no longer prepare spells. Instead, you prepare potions. A potion may be
consumed, splashed on a target for full effect. Otherwise, a potion may be sipped
or dipped(by a weapon/projectile) 5 times to produce a weaker version of the
potion's effect. Each potion's effect is based on a spell. You may prepare up
to 8 potions during a rest. When you prepare a potion, you must have ingredients
worth a certain gold amount per spell level. Spell effects are rolled randomly
on a mage spell list table appropriate to your level.

```
+-------------+-----------------------+
| Spell Level | Ingredient cost in GP |
+-------------+-----------------------+
|           1 |                     5 |
|           3 |                    25 |
|           5 |                    50 |
+-------------+-----------------------+
```


## Sorcerer
You no longer prepare known spells. Instead, you may cast spells at will and 
make a corruption check. To make the check, roll a 1d6. On a 1, roll for a
category of corruption, then a particular corruption within that category.

```
+-------+--------------------------------+
| Roll  |            Outcome             |
+-------+--------------------------------+
| 1     | Severe corruption              |
| 2-10  | Anomaly                        |
| 11-19 | Minor corruption               |
| 20    | Beneficial corruption          |
+-------+--------------------------------+

## Psion: 
You no longer prepare spells. Instead, you may cast spells by using your psionic
die. To do so, roll your psionic die. If you roll a 1, the die shrinks. When
the die shrinks from 1d2, you may no longer cast spells. Your psionic die
returns to it's normal size when you finish a long rest.

### Higher casting
Casting a 3rd level spell requires two rolls, and a 5th level spell requires
three rolls. Roll one at a time, shrinking the die appropriately. If your die
shrinks from 1d2 before you finish rolling for a spell, it fails to cast.

## Bloodbender:
You no longer prepare spells. Instead, you cast spells by syphoning your life
energy(see table below). You have a special dagger called a (blood) letter.
Your letter drains life energy from creatures with blood when you attack them,
restoring a number of your hit points equal to damage dealt. Instead of rolling
your hit points, gain 4+CON at each level.
```
+-----------------+--------------------+
|   Spell Level   | Hit points drained |
+-----------------+--------------------+
| 1               | 1d4                |
| 3               | 2d4                |
| 5               | 2d10               |
| Non-bloodbender | 2d4                |
+-----------------+--------------------+

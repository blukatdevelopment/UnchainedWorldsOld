# Mage subclasses
This book contains variants of the mage defined in the player handbook. Refer
to the rules for the mage class, applying changes described here to it for any
given subclass.

## Runesmith
You may prepare spells by creating spell runes. A rune requires 10gp of ingreedients and one hour per level(10g, 30g, and 50gp). You may  You may cast the spell 

## Ritualist:
You may only prepare one spell of your choice at a time from the mage spell list, provided you meet the level requirement. You may spend 50GP and 1 day studying a spell from a scroll or book in order to convert it into a ritual. This erases it frm the spell scroll or book you got it from. Spell preparation time can be found below.

```
+-------------+------------------+
| Spell Level | Preparation time |
+-------------+------------------+
| 1           | 10 minutes       |
| 3           | 1 hour           |
| 5           | 8 hours          |

+-------------+------------------+
```

## Alchemist:
You no longer prepare spells. Instead, you prepare potions. A potion may be consumed, splashed on a target for full effect. Otherwise, a potion may be sipped or dipped(by a weapon/projectile) 5 times to produce a weaker version of the potion's effect. Each potion's effect is based on a spell. You may prepare up to 8 potions during a rest. When you prepare a potion, you must have ingredients worth a certain gold amount per spell level. Spell effects are rolled randomly on a mage spell list table appropriate to your level.

```
+-------------+-----------------------+
| Spell Level | Ingredient cost in GP |
+-------------+-----------------------+
|           1 |                     5 |
|           3 |                    25 |
|           5 |                    50 |
+-------------+-----------------------+
```


## Sorcerer
You no longer prepare known spells. Instead, you may cast spells at will and make a corruption check. To make the check, roll a 1d6. On a 1, roll for a category of corruption, then a particular corruption within that category.

```
+-------+--------------------------------+
| Roll  |            Outcome             |
+-------+--------------------------------+
| 1     | Severe corruption              |
| 2-10  | Anomaly                        |
| 11-19 | Minor corruption               |
| 20    | Beneficial corruption          |
+-------+--------------------------------+
```

## Druid:
You no longer prepare spells. Instead, you may cast spells by spending mana. You have a code of neutrality. It contains rules that will consume your mana when broken and a list of good deeds that grant mana when performed.

## Warlock:
You no longer prepare spells. Instead, you may cast spells by spending mana. You have an evil patron, who makes evil requests of you. Completing these evil requests earns you mana.

### Contacting your patron
You may spend 1 hour contacting your patron for X mana in order to listen for
new requests.

## Psion: 
You no longer prepare spells. Instead, you may cast spells by using your psionic die. To do so, roll your psionic die. If you roll a 1, the die shrinks. When the die shrinks from 1d2, you may no longer cast spells. Your psionic die returns to it's normal size when you finish a long rest.

### Higher casting
Casting a 3rd level spell requires two rolls, and a 5th level spell requires three rolls. Roll one at a time, shrinking the die appropriately. If your die shrinks from 1d2 before you finish rolling for a spell, it fails to cast. 


## Bloodbender:
You no longer prepare spells. Instead, you cast spells by syphoning your life energy(see table below). You have a special dagger called a (blood) letter. Your letter drains life energy from creatures with blood when you attack them,
restoring a number of your hit points equal to damage dealt. Instead of rolling your hit points, gain 4+CON at each level.
```
+-----------------+--------------------+
|   Spell Level   | Hit points drained |

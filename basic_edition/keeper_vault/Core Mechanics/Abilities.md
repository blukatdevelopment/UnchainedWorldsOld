## Ability Score
An ability score is a number from 1 to 20 that represents potency. Falling below 1 kills a character, and a [[PC]] may not have more than a 20 in any ability score.

## Ability Modifier
An ability mod is calculated from the score, and is applied to checks and saves(See: [[Checks]]). To calculate a mod, subtract 10 from it and divide by two, rounding down. For example:
- `12 - 10 = 2` -> `2 / 2 = +1`
- `5 - 10 = -5` -> `-5 / 2 = -2`

## Ability Score Arrays
You can refer to one character's ability scores as an array, represented with brackets and modifiers listed inorder. This is  For example, `[10, 17, 4, 12, 11, 15]` has 10 STR, 17 DEX, 4 CON, 12 INT, 11 WIS, and 15 CHA.

## Generating Ability Scores
A [[PC]] 's ability scores are generally created by rolling 3d6 for each position in an ability score array, and optionally replacing one score with a 14.

## General definition
A check is a die roll to determine whether a character's action succeeds. It involves rolling a [[D20]], adding a modifier if necessary, and comparing the result with a target number. If the result meets or beats the target number, the check succeeds. While mechanically identical, a roll to determine whether a character is able to passively resist something(such as poison, slippery ice, a magical effect) is called a **saving throw** or just a **save**. Checks to make attacks are often called **attack rolls.**

## Target Numbers
A target number is generally either called  difficulty class([[DC]]) for most most checks, or else armor class"([[AC]]) when used in attack rolls.

## Modifiers
Often abbreviated to "mod", a modifier changes the odds of succeeding a given check. A roll with no modifier(ie +0) is considered a flat D20 roll. Ability checks(ie strength check, intelligence check) use the character's ability score([[Abilities]]) as a modifier. Frequently, [[Perks]] grant bonuses that add a flat number or the result of another die roll to the result of a check.

## Advantage/Disadvantage
When a roll for a check is made with advantage or disadvantage, two D20s are rolled. Advantage uses the higher of the two, while disadvantage uses the lesser of the two.

## Skipping rolls

### Obvious Success/Failures
Sometimes an action is impossible(ie flapping one's arms to fly), or trivially easy(ie failing to lift a small box). In those cases, you can either say "that won't work" or "you succeed" without any further thought.

## Inconsequential checks/Boring failure states
Sometimes a failure might be realistically possible, but a failure is boring and a success won't hurt [[Verisimilitude]]. Without time time pressure, making checks will eventually lead to success. Thus, unless there are finite resources(such as time left to complete a [[quest]]) at stake, you may wish to hand-waive checks to investigate the contents of a room and find a clue, loot a body, or set up camp for the night.

## Passive Checks
Sometimes an action can succeed or fail based on how high a the [[PC]]'s ability is, and the outcome isn't random. For instance, using STR to kick a door open or lift a heavy box. It would make little sense if a strong character failed, and then a weak one succeeded. The keeper might simply say "If your STR score is at least 14, you succed." or "If yout STR score is lower than 14, you'll need to roll". If a skill is relevant to the check, you may require the PC has that skill. If a skill is used in a passive check, add half the size of its skill die.

## Passive Saves
Sometimes you want to make checks in secret. An [[NPC]] sneaks up on the party(Passive WIS), a hallucinogen is in the air(Passive CON), or there are nearby sleeping enemies(Passive DEX). If you plan to use these sorts of elements, you may wish to collect these passive values before each session begins so that you have up-to-date information and the players will not know when you actually intend to use it.

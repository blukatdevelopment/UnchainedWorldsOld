Combat Vignette
Sometimes, drawing up a battleﬁeld,
placing tokens, and rolling initiative isn't
worth the time. In such a case, rules may be
applied in a fuzzy fashion to get to
interesting decisions and outcomes quickly.
Taking the example of eliminating a scout
silently, a combat vignette may resolve the
entire combat(silently eliminating the
scout), or may lead into a pitched battle(the
scout successfully alerts its nearby allies).
Pitched Battle
When tactical combat is desired by players
or keeper, time is taken to draw terrain and
place tokens on a gridded map. Individuals
on the same side of the conﬂict take their
turns together simultaneously, acting as a
team. Unless there is an obvious advantage
of surprise, each side rolls a D6 and the
highest roll goes ﬁrst(rerolling on a tie).
Once each side has taken their actions, the
ﬁrst round ends and the second begins
using the same order.
Weapon Types
Unarmed
Your bare ﬁsts, palms, ﬁngers, toes, knees,
teeth, horns, or head. Standard damage is
D2.

Knives, daggers, darts, wooden stakes,
handaxes, clubs. Standard damage is D4.

Swords, spears, javelins, clubs, sabers,
battleaxes. Standard damage is D6.

Greatswords, greataxes, greatclubs.

Ranged
Shortbows, longbows, crossbows, muskets.

Making attacks
Make a STR check for melee attacks, or a
DEX check for ranged attacks. Add any
bonuses from relevant perks. If your attack
roll meets or beats the AC of the target, it
hits. Rolling a 20 on the D20 for an attack
roll always hits and deals max damage,
whereas a 1 always misses. Roll a damage
die according to the weapon you're using(iea D2 for unarmed).
Serious Injury table(D6)
Each time you take damage and you have
less than 1HP after, you are seriously
injured and must roll on this table.
6. You are lucky: nothing happens
5. Dazed: 1 action per turn for 1 hour
4. Temporary injury(removed with medical
care/magic healing)
3. Maimed
2. Unconscious. Re-roll at start of turn until
stabilized
1. You die

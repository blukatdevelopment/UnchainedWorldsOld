The scars
The descendents of the Titans cling to the ruins jutting out from the desert. The shifting sands occasionally reveal entrances to untouched Titan ruins, but only ever for a day or two before they are buried again.

Breathless Archipelago
A constellation of satellites and space stations formed around Archon, city of seven green rings. Ascended during the Titan age, much of the  archipelago has been abandoned due to mutation, monsters, war, and hundreds of years without supplies from the surface.

Wild Lands
A land where scattered warlords wield weapons from the dragon age against a ceaseless advance of monsters and magical entities from the tunnels.

Steam Lands
The steel barons reign supreme through steam engines and gunpowder. They are locked in proxy wars to reclaim monster-infested lands and to expand their corporate empires.
## The Hells(Fiendish Plane)
An infinite war rages between the devils([[Devils]]) at the top and the demons([[Demons]])

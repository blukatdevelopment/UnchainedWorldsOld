Using Pact Magic
Select at least one patron, a powerful
magical entity who forms a pact to oﬀer
their magic. You maintain a list of spells by
praying for them. To cast a spell, you make
a spell check against the DC of the spell in
question in order to cast successfully. Your
pact magic modiﬁer is WIS + pact bonus,
and the spell DC is 10 + WIS + pact bonus.
Casting a pact spell takes one action. If you
fail a spell check, that spell is exhausted
until you complete a favor for your patron.
Before you cast, you may use an action to
charge a spell, adding a D6 bonus to the
spellcheck. You may charge a spell twice,
but can only charge a spell cast on the same
turn.
Praying for Spells
During a rest, you may pray for a spell,
describing it with two words such as
"Healing Word" and roll on the table below.
The keeper creates a spell to ﬁt the patron
and roll. You may replace an existing spell
if it is not exhausted.
Roll 2d6 for a result below.

Class: Sorcery
The magic of the foolish and desperate,
sorcery transforms their body into a font of
magical power. This transformation
corrupts the caster, changing them in
fundamental ways. Most cities forbid
sorcery under grounds of public safety, as
those corrupted by it are reputed to harbor
evil ambitions a temple or mages guild
would refuse to indulge. When you gain a
level in this class, select a type of sorcery.
This informs the manifestation of your
corruption as well as the spells and perks
you gain.
Casting Sorcery Spells
The runes of any sorcery spells you know
appear as glowing tattoos on your body. It
takes one action to cast a spell via sorcery.
You may cast each one once, causing the
tattoo to vanish. To regain the tattoo, you
may either complete a rest, or expend D4 of
your HP to rapidly recharge it. The
spellcasting modiﬁer is CON + sorcery
bonus, and you spell DC is 10 + CON +
sorcery bonus.

the table comes up with an idea for an
appropriate corruption, and you may
choose one of these as the corruption you

Gaining sorcerous power changes you.
Refer to the relevant type of sorcery for the
nature of the corruption, then roll on the

Wild Magic Sorcery
Exposure to reﬁned alchemical agents is
the one sureﬁre way to convert any
creature into a monstrosity. Wise
alchemists go to great lengths to ensure a
drop of the stuﬀ never touches their skin.
You bathe in the stuﬀ. In your heart, you
know you're strong enough to weather the
changes. You know you won't end up
another pitiful monstrosity.
Level Perks
Level 3. Dark Vision
You can now see in the dark up to 60ft.
Level 6. At-will Mutation
During a rest, you may lose all spells and
replace them with new totally random
spells.
Demonic Sorcery
You speak incantations in the forbidden
abyssal language, and you begin to hear
several voices joining in, whispering at
ﬁrst. They ﬁll you with a strange power. As
you reﬁne your technique, the voices grow
pronounced enough that you can hear the
evil things they are saying. Learning to
draw power from these voices, they all
begin to sound the same. You begin to
recognize your own voice speaking back to
you. Such is the nature of demonic
corruption.
Level Perks
Level 3. Flesh Feast
You may consume the ﬂesh of a creature to
restore all your hitpoints, but may not eat
from the same creature twice.
Level 6. Non-magical Resistance
You take half damage from non-magical
attacks.
Undead Sorcery
You are not content with this mortal vessel
you were born into, and so seek a more
permanent solution. This solution is a soul
gem, a crystal whose structure may contain
a living soul. You endeavor to transfer your
soul into it, little by little, and transcend
your bodily form. It is to be expected that
your body may grow gaunt, wither, and
decay away as you reach more advanced
states of transfer.
Level Perks
3. Imbue undeath
You may exhaust a spell to grant 10 THP to
yourself or another creature.
6. Undead Amortality
If your body is destroyed, your intact soul
gem may be inserted into a pile of bones to
raise it as a new body.
Fey Sorcery
You wish to gain fey magic, but not through
a patron. Instead, you engage in Fey
trickery. You answer their riddles and oﬀer
your own. You trade memories to them, or
the color of your eyes or hair. You sleep in
fey-heavy spots such as mushroom circles,
groves, or cliﬀ faces. You listen to the faint
singing of the nymphs that bring the
morning dew and which blossom wild
ﬂowers. You begin to hear the voices of all
things, from towering trees to lowly
pebbles. This awareness irreversibly
transforms you.
Level Perks
Level 3. True Names
If a creature gives you their name, they
have disadvantage on saves against your
spells.
Level 6. Steal Spell
When a creature targets you with a spell,
you may make a WIS save against their
spell DC to prevent it from casting. You
may temporarily replace one exhausted
spell with spell you stole.

Naming Magic
Myths of ages past tell of the Titans, who
ascended to godhood by learning the true
names of all things. The titans commanded
mountains to move, and so they did. It is
said the slayers of Titanfall could only cut
through Titan ﬂesh by speaking the true
name of their adversary. It was prophesized
a child of the empire of man would one day
utter a Titan's name and wake it from the
dead. Whether these stories are true, they
are widely held as truth and naming magic
is banned in most lands. Those who
practice it know the art to be less dramatic.
One does speak the name of a thing to
command it, but there's no record of a
namer moving mountains in the current
era.
Using naming magic
You may use an action to cast a spell. To do
so, select one or more names you know and
describe a spell to the keeper, who will
assign a cost in HP for casting the spell.
More powerful and complex spells will
require more of your energy to invoke.
Before casting on a given turn, you may use
an action to charge this spell, granting a D6
bonus to the check. You may charge a spell
twice, but charging does not eﬀect your
next turn's spellcasting. Your spellcasting
modiﬁer is CHA + naming bonus, and your
spell DC is 10 + CHA + naming bonus
Runesmithing
During a rest, you may forego healing to
carve a runestone containing one spell. To
carve a runestone requires 5Sp of
materials. Using one name, describe a spell
as if casting it. The cost in HP is subtracted
only from the healing this rest provides.
When your rune is complete, it contains the
spell, your current spellcasting modiﬁer,
and your spell DC, which will be used
whenever the rune is cast. Casting the spell
stored in a rune takes one action and turns
the runestone to dust.

Using Skill Dice
Anyone may perform any skill, making
ability checks to do so. However, only those
with levels in skills have access to skill dice.
A skill die represents proﬁciency in one
particular skill, and may be added as a
bonus to any checks where that skill is
used. For example, someone with an
athletics skill die may apply it to a STR or
DEX check for playing a sport, but also to
an INT check for recalling facts about
sports.
Growing a Skill Die
If you gain the beneﬁt of increasing a skill
die, it increases on size. This progresses
from D6->D8->D10->D12->D20.

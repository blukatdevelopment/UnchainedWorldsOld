Arcane magic works by systems of complex
runes that work with one another when
invoked. Creating a new spell is a
dangerous and time-consuming process.
Most arcane mages simply copy existing
spells rather than spending years to create
their own. When casting an arcane spell,
the modiﬁer is INT + arcana bonus, and the
spell DC is 10 + INT + arcana bonus. Casting
an arcane spell takes two actions.
Spell Focus
A spell focus such as a wand, staﬀ, or
medallion allows a caster to cast a written
spell with the focus's stored magic. When
you cast a spell using a spell focus, you
consume one charge from it. During a rest,
you may forego some healing in order to
restore charges, gaining one charge per HP
of healing consumed. One may attune to a
single focus at any one time, doing so
during a rest. Attuning to a focus assigns
the focus the number of charges awarded
from the arcane magic perk.
Craft: Arcane Magic
Each time you select this perk choose one
of the following:
- Add one charge to your spell focus
- A random perk

4-8. Spellcasting Bonus
+1 to arcane spellcasting and spell DC.
9-10. Ability Score Increase

11. Discovery
Acquire one random spell.
12. Economy of Scale
When you create three scrolls during a rest,
you may make one additional scroll
without foregoing any more healing.
Learning New Spells
You may spend downtime copying spells
from mentors, libraries, merchants, or
other sources. No matter who you learn
from, the common spells listed in this
section are available. Beyond this, you may
be required to pay, build trust, or quest for
spells. Most arcanists are weary to share
destructive spells, which may cause
disasters that come back to bite them.
Other arcanists simply charge top coin to
copy their most potent spells. Each day of
downtime allows you to learn and copy one
spell into your spell book.
Spell Scrolls
Copying an arcane spell onto a scroll
allows a mage to reliably cast that spell at a
later time without expending a charge from
a spell focus. When you attempt to create
the scroll, you consume 5sp of materials
and forego 1HP of healing for that rest. The
scroll is created with your current spell
mod and DC, which will be used when
casting it later. When a spell scroll is
invoked, it casts successfully and then
burns to ash.

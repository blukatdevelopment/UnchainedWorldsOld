Those who pray in fairy circles or groves in
the wilderness will often be visited by the
subordinate nature spirits of the local Arch
Fey.
The Courts
The Arch Fey are divided into elemental
courts of Fire(Summer), Air(Spring),
Water(Autumn), and Earth(Winter). Their
allegiances are ever-shifting in a complex
web, but favor cooperation among the
same court.
Fey Magic
Fey magic generally embodies the element
and season of the patron. Common spells
include Magic Berry, Bark Skin, Beast
Sense, Plant Growth, Guardian Spirit,
Consult Spirits, Air Blast, Flame Sword,
Hurl Stone, Ice Shards, and Bestow Curse.
In addition to spellcasting, the Fey may be
contacted to make spoken pacts trading
one thing for another. One example may be
trading one's eyes for that of an animal, or
trading one's skill for a magical Fey perk.
Fey Favors
The Fey are known for making requests
that are riddles, such as asking for three
matches and provided no other context.
Additionally, favors may include assisting
forest spirits threatened by encroaching
industry, or hunting invasive monsters. The
Arch Fey also accept novel gifts, despising
dull and repetitive oï¬€erings.

Those who meditate blindfolded in a bath
of heavily salted water report feeling a
presence. Focusing on this presence often
reveals a silhouette of a spindly creature in
the mind's eye. Neither divine, demon,
devil, nor fey, these creatures are an
enigma that baï¬„es most priests and
diviners.
Commune With the Deep
The deeper into the meditation a person
goes, the more concrete the presence
becomes. The deep ones communicate
non-verbally, granting visions containing
literal and symbolic imagery.
Deep Magic
The power granted by the deep ones
manifests as an extension of one's mind via
psionic ability. Common spells include
Force Blade, Telekinetic Hand, Amplify
Fears, Probe Mind, Manifest Flame,
Manifest Lightning, Consume Memory,
Manifest Nightmare, Foresee Attacks,
Impart Knowledge, Transfer Life, and
Dominate Creature.
Deep Favors
The visions of the deep ones show the
meditator performing seemingly random
acts: deface one particular book, carve a
rune on the back of a painting, swap the
positions of two jars in a random pantry,
leave a pile of rations at the mouth of a
cave, or steal a lobster from a restaraunt
and return it to the sea. Other times, more
sinister actions: place a strange slug in a
person's bedroom, burn down a building, or
attack a person and drive them out of town.

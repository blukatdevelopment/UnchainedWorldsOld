Metal statues of Solus appear at the altars
of his temples, glowing red hot from
attached furnaces. He appears as a ﬂaming
sword with the eye of a lion on the hilt. His
worshippers bow to him as the god of war,
ﬁre, swords, smithing, and the punisher of
evil.
Solus's Endless War
A temple of Solus is a parade ground for
holy warriors and features a forge at the
altar. Blades are holy to Solus and his
followers. Each warrior swears a pact to
dedicate their mind, body, and soul to the
endless war against evil. When their body
dies, their soul is trapped in their sword
and renders it magical power. Some great
swords are marked with the names of a
dozen or more past wielders. No follower is
excempt from service to the war. Those
who cannot ﬁght smith weapons and
armor, or else bring aid to those in more
direct roles.
Solus's Magic
Warcasters through and through, Solus's
mages use a ceremonial blade(dagger,
sword, greatsword) as a spell focus to cast
with. This same blade is the one that will
ultimately capture their soul and become
magical if the mage dies. Common spells
include Holy Flame, Soaring Blade, Searing
Smite, Flaming Orb, Create Ration,
Flaming Armor, Spiritual Weapon, Heroic
Aura, Detect Evil, Turn Undead, Banish
Fiend, Healing Aura, and Resist Evil.
Solus's Favors
While he may ask to slay a monster, often
he instead asks for service or tribute to be
paid to a temple, to guard a supply caravan,
or to recover the sword of a fallen warrior.

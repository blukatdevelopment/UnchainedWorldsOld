Anyone may pray to Coent by drawing a
circle on the ground representing the
moon, the symbol of this divine. While
Coent represents true neutrality in its
totality, it shifts between the extremes of its
avatars.
The Faces of Coent
Coent becomes Coento on each full
moon, a man with a messy mane of blonde
hair and golden eyes who stands for light,
sociability, and giving. On each new moon,
Coent appears as Coenta, a woman with
long black hair and pitch-black eyes,
standing for shadow, introspection, and
receiving. Between those times, Coent
appears as either Coentos or Coentas,
avatars of a mixture of both light and
shadow.
Coent's Magic
Shadow monks often wear all black and
wield the shadows of Coenta, while light
priests who wear all white wield the light of
Coento. Others wear white and black,
wielding both light and shaodw. Most
mages of Coent use some form of lunar
spells, hower. Common spells are Shadow
Form, Shadow Gate, Shadow Step, Shadow
Blade, Darkness Sphere, Lunar Bolt, Moon
Glaive, Protective Moon, Healing Glow,
Light Form, Beam Step, and Blinding Light.
Coent's Favors
Coenta asks for a day of reclusive
meditation in absolute darkness to cleanse
the soul and break attachments. Coento
demands a performance embodying the
mage's inner light before an audience.
Coentos and Coentas oï¬€er favors in
exchange for donating small cakes shaped
like the current phase of the moon.

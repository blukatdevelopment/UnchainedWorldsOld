Father of the beastfolk depicted as a
bullfolk man wielding a farmer's pitchfork.
Worshippers pray directly to Raos from
wherever they may be.
The Lessons of Raos
The pious who pray to Raos for wisdom
hear his voice telling parables. No two worshippers have received the same story,
and the morals of these parables contradict
one another more often than not. Youth are
lead to take these lessons to heart. Adults
learn to weave the many contradictions
together to reï¬‚ect their own wisdom.
Raos's Magic
Glowing amber beast spirits accompany
the great Bull's magic. Common spells
include WIld Shape, Healing Hand,
Obsidian Claws, Beast Speech, Spirit Mark,
Protective Aura, and Message Creature.
Raos's Favors
Those who wish to pay favors to Raos are
turned to the community. Helping those in
need is the only way to restore an
exhausted spell of Raos. When one restores
a spell, they gain D10 THP which does not
go away when they rest. As long as the
mage has this THP, a magical amber tattoo
of a heart appears on their chest.

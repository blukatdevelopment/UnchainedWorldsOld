Goddess of discovery. Her worshippers
gather in libraries where statues depict her
as a woman wielding a pen and magnifying
lens.
The Libraries of Exia
Scattered across Crucible are libraries
made for Exia. Some are great stone
structures, and others consist of a small
shelf with a handful of clay tablets. Those
who bring discoveries back to a library
earn Exia's favor, as do those who teach
others to read and write.
Exia's Magic
Shimmering teal runes ﬂoat about those
who cast her magic. Common spells
include Magic Missile, Mage Shield, Mage
Armor, Floating Disk, Acid Splash, Identify
Item, Read Mind, Telepathic Message,
Minor Restoration, Diagnose Curse,
Illuminate Creature, and Conjure Item.
Exia's Favors
Typical favors include donating artifacts to
the library, conducting archaeological
expeditions, and exchanging information
with other libraries. In addition to restoring
spells, libraries may oﬀer arcane spells
scrolls to show grattitude.

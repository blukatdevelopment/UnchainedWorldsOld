Father of the Bimrans, creator of law.
Bimros speaks only through the temples
and shrines featuring his obelisk.
Law of Bimros
Before he ascended to the Heavens, Bimros
erected obelisks with seven laws on them
for his worshippers to follow. The many
competing interpretations of these laws
have lead to division, strife, and bloodshed
among his followers.
1. Pray to no other
2. Burn the wicked
3. Speak no evil
4. Wear not red, the color of demons
5. Build houses of three
6. Tell no lie
7. Oﬀer bread to the temple to atone for
sins
Bimros's Magic
Casters are generally surrounded in
heatless blue ﬂames. Common spells
include Judgement Scythe, Feathery
Wings, Compell Truth, Spirit Shield, and
Healing Flame.

Bimros's Charms
Each temple of Bimros dispenses wooden
charms as a reward for good deeds. Some
give these charms for donations, while
others ask favors, or designate wicked
individuals to apprehend. Those with many
charms are viewed as pious. Burning three
charms as a sacriﬁce will restore an
exhausted spell. You may burn one charm
as part of casting a spell to grant that spell
advantage.

Rulers of the hells, the arch devils bind
themselves to an infernal law which allows
them to create magically-binding
contracts. Those who wish to contact one
of these avaricious beings needs only chant
their name.
Patrons of Evil
Those who make oﬀerings often do so in
appeasement, appealing to one devil for
protection from the others. The foolish and truly desperate go a step further and speak
pactrs with devils. The ultimate goal for
devil patrons is to cultivate an evil within
their followers that they may exploit. In
almost every city or town, the penalty of
devil magic is death, and so those that
sustainably pursue this craft do so outside
the visibility or reach of the law.
Infernal Magic
Beneath the particular aesthetic of any
given devil, the the mechanics are similar.
One gains at the expense of another.
Grizzly material components are
commonly consumed to amplify the
strength of infernal spells. The magic
likewise manifests as temporary
corruptions to the caster. Common spells
include Devil Sight, Flame Breath, Hellish
Rebuke, Infernal Fortitude, Corrupting
Hex, Consume Soul, and Forge Devil.
Infernal Favors
Devils often seek live sacriﬁce. Chickens,
goats, cows, or even humanoids.
Sometimes they seek the heart of a beast.
Often times, devils will attempt to wear
down the integrity of their mages, oﬀering
a choice of two favors, with the easy favor
breaking their ethical code.

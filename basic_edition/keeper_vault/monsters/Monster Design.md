## Power Level
Monsters can be designed to fit roughly into different categories based on how powerful they are. Power level is like a weight class more than anything else. A small group of minions with crossbows could be very deadly. At the same time, a boss creature might be a bag of hit points that a party can mow through.

### Level 0: Minion
The purpose of a minion is to beef up the number of combatants without adding much challenge. A commoner could take a few of these in a fight. Minions can be sent in swarms or given buffs via equipment or spells in order to make them more fearsome. Minions with firepower are satisfying glass cannons to fight. Minions are also useful for ambushes or to supplement an existing force.
#### Weak Minion
```
HP: 1, AC: 8, [-1], 1 action
Attack +1 D2
```
#### Strong Minion
```
HP: 5, AC: 10, [0], 2 actions
Attack +2 D4
```
### Level 1: Mooks
Mooks are the equivalent to low-level humanoids. They are individually weak, but with tactics become very dangerous. Mooks can be made more powerful with weapons and armor upgrades, but they should not be wielding much in the way of cool abilities if they are humanoids.
#### Commoner
```
HP: 10, AC: 10, [0]
Attack +1 D6
```

#### Foot Soldier
```
HP: 16, AC: 16(Shield + leather). [+3]

### Level 2: Elite Mooks
Elite mooks are the rough equivalent to player characters and can wield PC [[Perk]]

### Level 3: Mini-Boss

Greatclub +5 D12
```

### Level 4: Boss
A strong party may be able to tear down a boss. While weaker enemies can also get this treatment, bosses are best for multiple stat blocks with independent HP pools as well as lair actions.

### Level 5: Epic Boss
An epic boss might easily [[TPK]] a level 20 party, but are killable. Siege weapons, power armor, and armies may be put to use to reliably kill one of these things. They are capable of rampaging through cities unmatched by guards and garrisons.

#### Dragon

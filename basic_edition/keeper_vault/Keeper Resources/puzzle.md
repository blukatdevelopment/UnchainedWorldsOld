A puzzle is an [[encounter]] that may be a [[trap]], [[obstacle]], or [[social encounter]] that requires some sort of logic game, riddle, or non-obvious answer in order to resolve with minimal or no cost. While an obstacle such as a river may become a puzzle solved by whit, encounters designed as puzzles are typically contrivances designed by [[NPC]]s. Unlike a trap, a puzzle has at least one solution built in, and is intended to allow people who can solve it through unharmed.

## Examples
- Password that is the answer to a riddle
- Positioning statues according to rules
- A door that opens when a certain [[spell]] is cast

A villain is an antagonistic NPC which either performs evil acts or actively works to prevent good goals from being achieved.

## Static Villains
A **static villain** is irredeemably evil. While there may be multiple paths to beat a static villain, diplomacy is not a viable option. Usually, a static villain's motives are only flavor/backstory, and cannot be exploited by the party because the villain lacks any meaningful internal conflict. These are one-note, black-and-white villains that serve as an excuse for the party to exert violence and dominance. Failure to deliver the killing blow always punishes the party. Endless swarms of inhuman enemies fit this mold.

## Dynamic Villains
A **dynamic villain** features a strong internal conflict about their evil actions, or else some ignorance or misunderstanding that prevents them from realizing the evil of their actions. While a DC 20 CHA check might not sway them, it's possible to either weaken their resolve, neutralize them, or even convert them into an ally. Undertale villains fall largely into the latter category. Unlike in Undertale, the pacifist route with dynamic villains could boil down to a utilitarian calculation weighing the ongoing harm of the villain versus the harm of killing the villain. Such a moral dilemma is up for the players to figure out.

## Power Level
A villain represents a significant obstacle for the party to overcome. As such, they will typically be powerful, drawing from one of the following sources.
- An army
- A well-defended home base
- An epic stat block(such as a dragon)
- An unusual defense(such as being hidden, having martyr potential, or acting fully within the protection of the law)
- Epic powers(immune to magic/non-magical damage, being unkillable, except for a flaw)

## Villain Flaws
A **flaw** is an exploitable weakness like a vampire's garlic/sunlight/stake, a zombie's holy water, or a demon's main body, or losing their powers during an alignment of the stars. The villain will likely attempt to hide this weakness, and a party seeking to defeat a villain will either earn an instawin or a fighting chance against a villain by learning their flaw. This may open up additional quests to discover said info.

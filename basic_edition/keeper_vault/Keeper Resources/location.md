A sub-section of the [[world]].  Locations may appear as discrete points on a world map. Locations may be nested, such as with a specific box in a room in a building in a district in a city in a region in a plane.

## As map marker
The most common use of location is as an icon appearing on a map. A city, point of interest, or even the space where a [[random encounter]] occurs.

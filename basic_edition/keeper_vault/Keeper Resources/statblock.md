A statistical representation of a [[pc]] or [[npc]].

## PC statblocks
These are created during [[character creation]] and upgraded via [[advancement]]. Typically, this involves an [[ability array]], [[hp]], [[AC]], [[attack]]s, [[perk]]s, and [[spell]]s. Inventory is likewise part of a [[PC]] statblock.
## NPC statblocks
An NPC statblock functions as a blueprint. Variability may be baked into a statblock in order for instances to differ from one another, but two creatures sharing the same statblock are intended to be very similar, if not mechanically identical. Further reading: [[Monster Design]].

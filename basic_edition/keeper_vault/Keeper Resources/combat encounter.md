A combat encounter is an [[encounter]] which is very likely to result in [[combat]].

## Unavoidable combat
A [[quest]] may contain unavoidable combat as static [[plot]] elements such as confronting a [[villain]] or being ambushed. Additionally, [[random encounter]]s may involve ambushes

## Avoidable combat
A combat encounter may be prepped with [[monster]]s, terrain, and social details that allow players to circumvent it either by converting it into a [[social encounter]], [[stealth encounter]], or simply avoiding the encounter altogether by [[exploration]] for alternative routes.

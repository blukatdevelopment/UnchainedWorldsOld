A timer is used as a [[trigger]] for an event. 

## Timers in perk and spell design
A [[perk]] or [[spell]] may create an effect that lasts for the duration of a timer. The power of either may be tuned by changing the duration of the timer.
## Timers in encounter design
One may add [[urgency]] and tactical depth to a [[combat encounter]] by adding a negative event which will take place after a timer expires. One example may be an environmental change such as a groaning support beam breaking and causing debris to fall and the battlefield to tilt. Other examples include enemy reinforcements arriving, a buff taking effect or running out, or an alarm system alerting nearby enemies.

## Timers in quest design
A [[Quest]] may benefit from a timer as a form of [[constraint]].

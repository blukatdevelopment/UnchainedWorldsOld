A **plot** is a meta-game structure which seeks to shape direct into more dramatically-satisfying forms.

## Static Elements
**Static elements** of a plot are fixed, immutable elements which the players lack any form of agency over. They requires special consent/buy-in from players. An example of this would be a [[premise]] of a plot's [[season]]/[[chapter]]/[[episode]].

## Dynamic Elements
**Dynamic elements** emerge from player choices. They may be instantiated as a [[Plot event]] with specific triggers, such as releasing a vampire from a glass tube, which turns out to be a dormant [[villain]].

A **constraint** may be the choice of one of three locations, or the time constraint before the full moon, or even the confined scope of playing within a hotel. Players, if they set their mind to it, can figure out how to circumvent these constraints(such as splitting the party between two locations), but they don't if the keeper gets their [[buy-in]]. A constraint set at the beginning of play is a [[premise]].

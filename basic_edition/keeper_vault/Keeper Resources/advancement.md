A [[mode of play]] wherein a player upgrades their [[PC]]'s [[statblock]].

## By XP
A [[PC]] earns [[XP]], and when it hits certain thresholds, they gain a level in a [[Craft]] of their choosing. Gaining a craft will grant [[perk]]s. 

## Boons
Perks and [[spell]]s can be gained without leveling up as [[quest]] rewards, by purchasing them from stores, or discovering them in the world as [[loot]].

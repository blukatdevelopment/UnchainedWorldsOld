Attrition is a phenomenon revolving around player resource management, the budgeting of at least one [[resource]].


## The adventuring day
PCs restore [[resource]]s such as [[perk]]s, [[hp]], and [[spell]]s when they take a [[rest]].  The time between rests is considered an adventuring day. During [[travel]], the adventuring day may seem very short for lack of [[encounter]]s. While exploring a [[dungeon]], the adventuring day may seem very long due to a high number of encounters and a limited opportunity to rest.

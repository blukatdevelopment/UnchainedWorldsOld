A premise is a set of initial conditions or [[constraint]]s on play that are agreed to before or at the very beginning of a campaign/adventure. Such may be "Aliens have landed on 3 locations. You have enough time to intercept 1" or "You must retrieve the rod of plot contrivance before the the next full moon", or "Figure out why people are going missing in the Totallynotcannibals hotel."

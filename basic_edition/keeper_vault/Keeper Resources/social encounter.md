An [[encounter]] that uses [[roleplay]] to navigate a social situation.

Generally, the party wants something from an [[NPC]], who is reluctant to grant it. [[pc]]s may interact with the npc to discover motives that they may exploit for greater leverage. Frequently, [[intimidation]], [[persuasion]], [[deception]], and [[quid pro quo]] are employed to complete a social encounter.

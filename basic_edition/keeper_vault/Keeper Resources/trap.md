A trap is something an [[npc]] constructs to endanger those wandering an area. A trap consists of a [[trigger]] and a payload. A trap's payload often acts as an alarm, slow of [[exploration]], or as a direct source of harm. Traps often can be found within a typical subterranean [[dungeon]]. Often, a trap works as an [[encounter]].

A resource is a thing that can be earned and then either spent or lost.

## Fungible resources
Currency in the [[world]], limited-use [[perk]]s, [[action]]s in combat, [[metacurrency]], [[Common Items]], time on a [[timer]], and [[hp]] are examples of fungible resources. Any given instance of the resource can be considered functionally identical. Fungible are the main resources players consciously manage in [[Attrition]]. 

## Non-fungible resources
Time, hirelings, relationships(such as with a merchant, informant, or mentor), tactical advantages, light-sources, and rare items are examples of non-fungible resources. A torch and candle have a similar function, but are not functionally identical in the way 10 silver pieces add up to 1 gold piece.

A trigger is a condition which causes an event to occur.

Examples of triggers are a [[timer]] running out, one creature entering a certain radius of another, a specific phrase being spoken, a creature being targeted by a melee attack, or a creature being reduced to a certain [[hp]] amount. A [[spell]] such as [[shield]] may be cast in response to a trigger.

Roleplay consists of acting through the lens of a [[pc]] or [[npc]], acting according to their motivations, personality, and limited knowledge.

## Dialogue
A player may have their PC speak, either paraphrasing or giving exact words. 

## Character bleed
The extent to which a character's emotions are empathized with and felt by the player is known as character bleed. Games with high character bleed lend themselves well to drama, whereas games with very low character bleed treat pcs similarly to board game pieces. Character deaths and [[TPK]]s are more intensely negative with greater character bleed.

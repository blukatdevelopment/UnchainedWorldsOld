### Sloth
You have one action per turn. Creatures within 30ft of you have two less actions per turn.

### Wrath
Your eyes glow red and your form fills with demonic strength. You gain a bonus to unarmed damage. The bonus is equal to the number of HP you are currently missing. Example: If you have 12/14HP, you have a +2 to unarmed damage.
### Envy
You turn pale green. You may focus on a feature of another creature, such as their spellcasting ability, scorpion tail, or weapon. You may consume half your current HP to force a contested WIS check between you two. If you succeed, their feature is destroyed and you gain it until this spell ends. In the case of an item, the original flies to you, gaining a curse.
### Pride
While you have full HP, you give off a radiant golden glow, have a +5 to AC, and deal an additional +5 to unarmed damage.

<br><br>
Roll on the table below.

### Divine spellcasting
- During a rest, you may pray to deity for a particular kind of spell using two words, which becomes the name of the spell

- You roll 2d6 for power level, keeper creates spell to fit
- When casting spell, you must make a **WIS** check against the spell's DC. Rolling a 1 on the D20 automatically fails
- If you fail the check, the spell becomes exhausted
- You can restore the spell by doing a request of the divine
- You may replace a spell during a rest, provided it is not exhausted

| 2d6   | DC | Title   |
|:------|:---|:--------|
| 2     |  5 | Cantrip |
| 3-6   |  8 | Weak    |
| 7-9   | 10 | Average |
| 10-11 | 12 | Strong  |
| 12    | 15 | Expert  |

For example, you may choose "healing word" and roll a 2, creating a "healing word cantrip" that requires a DC 5 spell check when casting. Or, you may choose "spiritual sword" and roll a 10, creating a "Strong healing word" that requires a DC 12 spell check to cast.

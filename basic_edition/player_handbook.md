### Crafting

#### Determine a crafting recipe
You may be able to determine more simple crafting recipes with a single check. Others, however, may require days of research working on a prototype from materials. A completed prototype renders an inferior prototype version of an item as well as a crafting recipe. A crafting recipe has a DC, a list of materials, and a rough crafting time.

#### Craft an item
Attempting to craft an item consumes the materials and some time. Upon a success, the item is created.

#### Repair an item
A successful crafting check reveals if an item can be repaired, any materials needed, time, and a DC. By consuming the time and materials, a repair may be attempted. Upon a failure of 5+, the broken item is destroyed beyond repair.

#### Harvesting
A successful crafting check will reveal any valuable crafting materials such as fur, hide, bone, scales, carapace, teeth, claws, resin, wood, or bark that can be harvested from a creature, plant, or object. These materials may be used in recipes, sold in their raw form, or be crafted into a value-added item such as a necklace or leather. A crafting check may be used to successfully harvest these materials, destroying them on a failure.

### Alchemy
Brewwing takes place over the course of a rest and requires relevant equipment.

#### Brew a tincture
Brewing a single alchemical ingredient with an alchemy check renders a tincture, which may fill flasks or vials. One flask, or four vials constitute a full dose that will render an alchemical effect.

#### Brew a potion
When brewing a potion, one combines multiple tinctures or other potions with a specific aim. One makes an alchemy check(Keeper provides DC based on complexity). The resulting potion has the same volume as the tinctures and potions that were used to make it. If the potion brewing fails, it becomes inert liquid.

### Medicine

#### Create Medicine
By consuming one medicinal ingredient and 10 minutes, one may attempt to create one of the following items:
- (DC 15)Ointment: Heals D4 HP, provided target has half or more of their max HP. Expires after one day.
- (DC 20)Purifying salve: Removes one poison-related condition, masks an active illness's symptoms
- (DC 20)Healer's kit: Same as in player handbook
- (DC 20)Smelling Salt: wake an unconscious creature back to 1HP
- (DC 25)Advanced healer's kit: Same as in player's handbook, except it heals 2d6 HP

#### Field Medicine
Attempt to place a splint on a broken limb, resussicate someone who is not breathing, or stop severe bleeding. The DC is determined according to the situation, and is significantly lowered if you consume a healer's kit when practicing field medicine.

## Foreword

- Familiarity with TTRPGs is assumed

# Creating Your Character

## Abilities
When performing actions, the keeper may call for ability checks. These are the abilities used.

- Strength(STR): Lift, climb, carry(6lb per score), grapple, throw, punch, and perform tasks that require brute force.
- Dexterity(DEX): Sprint, jump, duck, dodge, sneak, and perform acrobatic Techniques.
- Constitution(CON): Resist the effects of poison, toxins, fatigue, and illness. Determines your maximum hit points.
- Intelligence(INT): Process, calculate, remember, and reason through complex information. 
- Wisdom(WIS): Intuit, deduce, and read between the lines. Particularly good for resisting mind-altering magic, reading the intentions of others, and perceiving the world around you.
- Charisma(CHA): Joke, flatter, persuade, lie, bluff, perform, and intimidate others. Useful wherever talking or looking good is needed.

### Modifiers
The keeper may ask you to make a check to succeed an attempted action or to resist negative effects. Roll a 1d20 and add the modifier for the relevant ability.

| Score | Modifier |
|:------|:---------|
| 20    | +5       |
| 18-19 | +4       |
| 16-17 | +3       |
| 14-15 | +2       |

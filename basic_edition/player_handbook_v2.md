# Unchained Wolrds: Basic Edition 2e

## Foreword
- These rules are minimal
- Familiarity with TTRPGs is assumed
- The keeper creates the sandbox world to explore
- The players control player characters(PC) exploring that world

# Creating Your Character

## Name
1. Think up a few flavor words: Tree axe river stick
1. Combine them: Treeaxeriverstick
2. Steal three to four random syllables: Tre xe ver ick
3. Combine them to make your name: Trexeverick

## Abilities
When performing actions, the keeper may call for ability checks. These are the abilities used.

- Strength(STR): Lift, climb, carry, grapple, throw, punch, and perform tasks that require brute force.
- Dexterity(DEX): Sprint, jump, duck, dodge, sneak, and perform acrobatic Techniques.
- Constitution(CON): Resist the effects of poison, toxins, fatigue, and illness. Determines your maximum hit points.
- Intelligence(INT): Process, calculate, remember, and reason through complex information. 
- Wisdom(WIS): Intuit, deduce, and read between the lines. Particularly good for resisting mind-altering magic, reading the intentions of others, and perceiving the world around you.
- Charisma(CHA): Joke, flatter, persuade, lie, bluff, perform, and intimidate others. Useful wherever talking or looking good is needed.

### Modifiers
The keeper may ask you to make a check to succeed an attempted action or to resist negative effects. Roll a 1d20 and add the modifier for the relevant ability.

| Score | Modifier |
|:------|:---------|
| 20    | +5       |
| 18-19 | +4       |
| 16-17 | +3       |
| 14-15 | +2       |
| 12-13 | +1       |
| 10-11 | 0        |
| 8-9   | -1       |
| 6-7   | -2       |
| 4-5   | -3       |
| 2-3   | -4       |
| 1     | -5       |

### Generating Ability Scores
- Roll 4d6, drop the lowest roll
- This is your strength score
- Repeat for the other abilities
- If you don't get at least one 14, reroll
- When you're done, you may swap one pair of scores

## Other Stats

### Hit Points(HP)
- Reduced by taking damage
- If it falls below 1, you die
- HP = CON score

### Armor Class(AC)
- Determines whether an enemy attack hits you
- Higher is better
- Unarmored AC = 10 + your DEX mod

### Inventory Slots
- STR score = slots
- Identical items stack
|Size | Stack | Examples         |
|:----|:------|:-----------------|
|Large|     1 | Sword, rope, book|
|Small|     8 | Torch, ration    |
|Tiny |    16 | Chalk, paper, ink|
\page
# Combat
## Initiative
- Each side rolls a 1d6 and winner goes first
- Reroll on tie
- After both sides go, reroll

## On Your Turn
On each turn, you receive three actions.

### Actions In Combat
Using your action, you may perform many tasks. Some examples:
- **Attack**: Make an attack against a creature
- **Attack(2nd this turn)**: Has -3 penalty to hit
- **Attack(3rd this turn)**:  Has -6 penalty to hit
- **Move**: You move up to 6 paces(1 pace = 5feet)
- **Hide**: You may make a DEX check (DC 12) to hide from one or more creatures if your line of sight is broken.
- **Dodge**: You focus on avoiding incoming attacks, adding +5 to your AC
- **Cast a spell** (requires 2 actions)
- **Draw/Store/Use object**

#### Making Attacks
- Roll a D20
- Add STR(for melee) or DEX(for ranged) mod
- Add any other attack bonuses or penalties
- If your roll meets or beats the enemy's AC, you hit
- On a hit, roll your weapon's damage die
- If that D20 rolls a 20, the attack hits and you can roll an extra damage die
- If that D20 rolls a 1, the attack misses

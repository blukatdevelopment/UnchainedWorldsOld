Yo, this is Blukat! This is a discord bot in active development. It's made mostly because other bots either have no character sheet management, or are overly focused on proprietary game systems. Maybe I'll spruce up this doc to include better detail for installing and using this thing. Maybe I'll add this to a pile of abandoned projects. Only time will tell. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`


## Installing
1. `sudo apt install python3 libffi-dev libnacl-dev python3-dev sqlite3 python3-pip`
2. `pip3 install discord.py`

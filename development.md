### Revamp Psion
actually create those 'psionic abilities' we mentioned earlier
subclasses? who knows.

### Edit body_types.md
Check to make sure descriptions make sense, are formatted reasonably, and maybe 
add a tiny bit more details, such as a warning about limitations of tiny/huge folk.

### Create soulforger subclass: Technomancer
Gain abilities via prosthetics, create squad of forged followers.

### Create soulforger subclass: Pocket Trainer
Craft/generate collectable monsters that can be evolved.

### Create soulforger subclass: Demon Forger
Create demons. Powerful, but dangerous potential of them turning on you.

### Create soulforger subclass: Necromancer
Create undead. Become litch.

### Create class: Sympathist
Full caster. Build/shape spells by selecting correspondences. Ritual magic.

### Create class: Shaman
Animistic religious full caster. Wildshape

### Create class: Namer
Half-caster that combines element-based magic(air, fire, earth, water) with 
martial abilities.

### Create class: Sorcerer
Full caster that can cast infinitely. Learning spells corrupts the sorcerer. 
Every cast requires a success roll. On a crit fail, bad things happen.
Can eat stamina dice to negate the chance of a bad thing on a cast.
Can eat stamina dice to add metamagic to their cast.
Balancing act between safety and power.

### Create class: Bloodbender
Half-caster that gains magic resource by drinking the blood of self/others. 
Gains abilities powered by that same resource.

### Create class: Dragonborn
Half-caster that combines dragon-esque magic(breath attacks, flying, etc) with 
martial abilities.

### Create class: Monk
Martial class with dual health bar of meat(normal regen) and ki(which 
replenishes quickly). Menu of abilities that eat ki to do martial arts/shonen 
moves.

### Create class: Bard
A generalist CHA caster that gets skills, bardic inspiration, and a spell list
that contains lots of charm/psychic magic. Maybe let them rehearse(prepare) spells
on a rest or during a 10 minute break(eating a stamina die). Use spell slots or
stamina dice to cast. Maybe let them have a special slot where they can rehearse
a spell outside their spell list if they saw someone cast it in person in the
last 24 hours(level requirements still apply), and maybe let them keep preparing
that spell until they trade it out for another.
Maybe give them an choice of starter feats that specifies what kind of bard they
are as well (and offer some different art forms that give them a perk of some kind)

### Create class: Cultist
Evil version of priest: has patron that makes requests in order to build up 
spellcasting resources, which can be infinitely banked. Spells are tattooed 
onto self and followers.

### Illustrate culture: burden folk
